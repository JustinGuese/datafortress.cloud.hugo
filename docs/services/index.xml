&lt;h3 id="why-is-cloud-computing-so-important">Why is Cloud Computing so important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>$330 billion USD&lt;/strong> is the market prediction for the global public &lt;a href="https://www.datafortress.cloud/cloud-services/cloud-computing/">cloud computing&lt;/a> market in 2020&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>94% of workloads&lt;/strong> will be processed by Cloud data centers in 2021&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>These are huge numbers – but you might wonder if your company should either enter or extend its cloud presence or if it is safe to ignore this huge movement, but do not worry – we are here to clear up any misunderstandings.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="cloud-computing">Cloud Computing&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are looking for digital transformation for your company, you can engage with the Cloud offering holistic end-to-end computing services. Undoubtedly, Cloud computing offers a phenomenal delivery of computing services like networking, database, software, intelligence, analysis, storage, and servers. As a matter of fact, it is the smooth transition of conventional on-premise infrastructure to contemporary computing to companies looking for economies of scale, innovation, and flexible resources. Moreover, you will have to pay merely for its services you utilize and thereby lower your operating budget and run your infrastructure quite efficiently with the appropriate scaling of your business needs. In fact, you need not worry as regards the operational costs concerning staff training, equipment purchasing, and ongoing maintenance because these all are managed by cloud computing itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-cloud-computing">Types of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Considering the varied needs of businesses and individuals, several various distinct types, services, and models have developed gradually in due course of time. The different types of cloud computing have evolved to address the precise and appropriate solution considering the desired needs. You need to ascertain what type of cloud computing or deployment is required to be implemented at the very outset. In this connection, the following three types of cloud computing can be deployed and operated according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-public-cloud">1. Public Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Public Clouds are managed by cloud service providers being the third party and sole operator. All computing resources, including servers and storage on the internet, are provided by cloud service providers. As a matter of fact, the Public Cloud is operated and owned by cloud computing. You can avail of computing services like all software, hardware, and other infrastructure. It means all computing resources are managed in data centers instead of maintaining them on-premise. Thus, it consists of many companies using the same infrastructure. A few renowned hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft (Azure), Google cloud, and Alicloud dealing with massive scale as the largest cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-private-cloud">2. Private Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Private Cloud is more efficacious and better for those companies that want to share their resources on a Public cloud. In fact, the servers of these cloud models are owned and controlled by the companies themselves. This is accessed using the internet or a private network. This Cloud provides you an environment whereby you control the security and data, ensuring specific monitoring and other requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-hybrids-cloud">3. Hybrids Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As Hybrid Cloud suggests, it is the combination of several clouds. A few companies prefer to use a combination of cloud environments. This use of cloud combination environment is known as a Hybrid cloud model. The hybrid cloud approach typically combines private and public clouds that can share their data amongst them. The provision of sharing applications and data amongst the private and public clouds makes the business more flexible with extensive development options. Undoubtedly, this assists in maximizing your current infrastructure, especially compliance and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-cloud-services">Types of Cloud Services:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Generally, there are four types of Cloud services. These types are also called the cloud computing stack owing to their designed structure building on one another. If you want to accomplish your goal with ease, you have to understand these four categories, particularly as to how and what they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Iaas is the most rudimentary type of cloud computing. If you opt for this service, you will rent IT infrastructure. Your rent infrastructure includes storage, networks, virtual machines and servers, and an operating system. This infrastructure service is obtained based on a pay-as-you-go from a cloud computing provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-platform-as-a-service-paas">2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want an environment in respect of testing, developing, managing, and delivering distinct software applications, you will have to seek PaaS, a cloud computing services. In fact, the PaaS helps developers to make mobile apps, or different webs easily. Moreover, this platform also makes it easier to develop apps without any infrastructure of the database, storage, and servers required for the development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-serverless-computing">3. Serverless Computing:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Serverless computing extends over the PaaS, and it focuses on developing applications without spending sufficient time controlling the infrastructure needed to carry out. This cloud service manages server management, capacity development, and other set-ups. Its good characteristics are its architectures highly scalable that use resources only at a specific action.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-software-as-a-service-saas">4. Software as a Service (SaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is used commonly by a business to approach software applications. If you have SaaS, you can access a specific software app managed on a distant server. In fact, it is used on a subscription basis. In this respect, a web browser is used to access a remote server hosted by a third-party service provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-benefits-of-cloud-computing">The Benefits of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is no denying that Cloud computing has transformed the traditional style of business into a digital on-sign environment. There is a host of benefits of cloud computing, due to which a huge number of companies are approaching cloud computing services. You can also avail of these services awash with numerous benefits by visiting our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-cost">1. Cost:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It does away with your company&amp;rsquo;s operating cost, such as software and hardware purchases. Moreover, it would be best if you had not incurred the capital expenses regarding the electricity for power, the frames of servers, and the IT professionals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-speed">2. Speed:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The computing services are provided expeditiously, thereby making the business quite flexible. Therefore, a business having such benefits and flexibility can take the pressure off many things.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-scaling">3. Scaling:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Scaling is a huge advantage of cloud computing. Cloud computing using new technologies provides a way of automatic and digitalized scaling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-security">4. Security:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is more secure than many on-premise systems. Many on-premise system environments are set up once and never revisited, causing several security hazards. On the other hand, the cloud computing service providers keep constantly updating the serverless computing system particularly.
Besides, there are many other benefits like reliability, matchless performance, and efficacious productivity you can get using incomparable services of cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uses-of-cloud-computing">Uses of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud computing is regarded and admired for its competitiveness using distinct and glaring cost reduction, optimal use of resources, alluring flexibility, and of course, its elasticity. Following are the efficient uses of cloud computing, enhancing the capabilities to accomplish your business goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>One can develop a cloud-native application. He or she can use this app for mobile, web, and API, taking advantage of cloud-native approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Test and development environment is also one of the uses of a cloud. This encompasses saving you on-premise, reducing a budget volume, and creating an environment for your business through the crucial workforce, physical assets, and precious time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Big data analytics is significant to use of cloud computing whereby one can manage huge quantities of either kind of structured as well as unstructured data. This can be used to harness the advantage of drawing out business value.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is yet another benefit to extricate using cloud computing is the cost-effectiveness in respect of a disaster recovery way out. This gives an expeditious recovery against interlaced physical sites, especially at lower expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In addition to these discussed uses, there are a few more common uses like cloud storage, data backup, hybrid and multicolored, streaming audio and video, embed intelligence, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion-on-cloud-computing">Conclusion on cloud computing:&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before Cloud service providers, companies would confront various problems, and they had to use hard devices like servers and drives for data and software storage. But the cloud computing has transformed cumbersome traditional on-sight infrastructure into the digital computing system using the internet. Today, companies can adapt and scale at a swift speed, drive business with accelerated innovation. Furthermore, it has become quite convenient for companies to streamline their operations efficiently and economically, incurring lower expenses.

&lt;h2 id="data-science--engineering">Data Science &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data is becoming more and more important. Let us take a look at some examples to become a feeling in how far data will change in the future:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h5 id="1-people-are-generating-25-quintillion-bytes-of-data-each-day-1">1. People are generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day [1].&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>That is 2,5 with 30 zeros added to it, and that happens each day!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h5 id="2-90-of-all-data-available-on-the-planet-has-been-generated-in-the-last-2-years-1">2. 90% of all data available on the planet, has been generated in the last 2 years [1].&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>This means, that we far exceeded an exponential growth of data, and truly entered the data-driven age.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h5 id="3-of-this-data-95-remain-not-analyzed-1">3. Of this data, 95% remain not analyzed [1].&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Many businesses know that they need to collect data, but do not know what to do with it. In this 95 % of unanalyzed data very valuable information might be hiding, like your ideal target demographic, an undervalued product of yours, or a potential unicorn idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h5 id="4-by-2020-almost-all-data-processing-will-be-done-by-automated-processes-1">4. By 2020 almost all data processing will be done by automated processes [1].&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>All these data can not anymore be analyzed by people themselves. What might have worked in times of SAP and Excel, can not be manually done anymore. Therefore new tools, new technologies, and new processes need to be implemented to handle this enormous data mass.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Especially in times where more and more business transitions to the digital world, it is of the essence to make the switch into the data-driven age. Of course, this might upset many traditional businesses, but complaining does not help amidst this transition into a new world.&lt;br>
Your company will have the choice to either build up their own data team and architecture or use services and outsourcing to handle their data for good.&lt;br>
But to give you a glimpse of hope: Using this data can boost your sales and revenue in a never before seen manner. New markets and customers become available, new opportunities together with a global reach are at your fingertips. An upgrade of a process will not increase sales by 1% anymore, it might x10 your results. Keep reading to find out how your business can manage this transition.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Both techniques and approaches to deal with this massive amount of data can be summarized to “Data Science” and “Data Engineering”. Data Science deals with the analytical part of the process, meaning the step of data preparation, extraction, and deduction of results given data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data Engineering on the other hand deals with the technical background for a Data Scientist to work. This includes for example optimizing or deploying databases, special Big Data Frameworks, process optimization, or data preprocessing as well.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="data-science">DATA SCIENCE&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data science is a “concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and their related methods” in order to “understand and analyze actual phenomena” with data. &lt;a href="https://www.springer.com/de/book/9784431702085">[2]&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="data-engineering">DATA ENGINEERING&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data Engineering deals with the setup and usage of tools needed for a data scientist to work. This includes for example storage of data, parallel processing, and other things in tools like Hadoop, Spark, and similar.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data is becoming more and more important, but still 95% of data remains unused by companies. You might say to yourself “of course, there are many opportunities that I could follow with my company, why data?” – but one thing that should not be underestimated with data is that it is not just a small improvement of your product gaining 0.X % increase in sales, it is rather a transition of your company into the data-driven age, times X-ing your revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="br">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="example-1-ford-automotive">Example 1: Ford automotive&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As an example, let us have a look at the Ford automotive company. In 2006 their annual loss has been 12,6 billion USD. After that, a data scientist has been brought in to overhaul the company in the next three years into a more data-driven company. The result has been 2,3 million cars sold in 2009 and is in the green by the end of the year.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="example-2-supply-chain-improvements">Example 2: Supply chain improvements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Timing supply chain resources can be the deciding factor for a win or loss. To have the factory ready if a delivery arrives, or to avoid employees being idle are some factors that can be optimized with data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pitt Ohio Freight Company utilized data science to estimate the arrival of their drivers with a 99% accuracy rate, which increased their customers that much, that they gained another 50,000 USD a year by repeated orders. &lt;a href="https://conceptainc.com/blog/how-data-science-can-help-your-enterprise-generate-more-revenue/">(Source: T. Capone, How Data Science Can Help Your Enterprise Generate More Revenue (2018)&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="example-3-programmatic-advertising">Example 3: Programmatic Advertising&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using the information a company has about future or existing customers can leverage new revenue streams for previously undiscovered target groups or better targeting of ad spends. Traditional advertisements have a bad targeting, as all the people driving past a billboard, for example, might or might not see the ad, no matter if it is fitting or not. This is one the one hand quite expensive, as billboards cost a lot of money, and due to the fact that the average person is spammed by hundreds of ads a day, their attention span is really limited nowadays. What if we could just show our ad to the people that are most likely to be our customers, and target them with personalized information that fits their needs?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the classic “shooting a cannon at a bird” example. Billboards are like shooting a cannon at a small sparrow to catch it. I mean it works, but it also spends a lot of money on cannons, might injure a lot of other animals and is a huge effort. Why not use bait that targets sparrows specifically to catch only sparrows and it precisely?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The Economist”, an established print and online media, used programmatic advertising to drive potential unsure readers to finally subscribe. Their initial hopes were to gain 650’000 new customers. They used a combination of information they already had, plus derived information from geolocation, IP’s and several other information to show advertisements to “mirrored customers”, meaning potential new customers that are similar to existing ones. They identified their main segments in their publications, like “Finance”, “Politics”, “Careers” and others, and produced matching content which was then shown to the segmented mirrored customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results of this campaign have been astonishing. The goal of 650’000 customers was bet 5 times over, with 3,6 million new customers. Their newly gained lifetime value is estimated to be £11,970,000 (14,8 million USD), which is a return of invest (ROI) of 10:1. Furthermore, awareness for “The Economist” has been raised by almost 65%.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="what-is-a-data-lake">What is a Data Lake?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data lakes are essential for your Big Data landscape. In order to centralize all your data sources, be it SQL-databases, images, text data, E-mail, SAP, and others, an intermediate layer needs to be established in between your data science team and the data itself.&lt;br>
This layer manages communication between these different data structures, access control (who can access what), lifetime-policies (how long is data stored, data catalogs), and the security of these interactions (logging of access, security measures, timely-limited access, …).&lt;br>
The goal is to basically establish a “front-end” for all your data needs. Employees will be able to only access the data they are allowed to, where the access will be logged for forensics if needed, and can “load” them into their data analytics tools. A centralized gives both an overview of existing data and avoids building up several data “silos” or unnecessary duplicates in your company.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-is-data-engineering">What is Data Engineering?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data scientists should focus on their data analytic processes. But given the 80/20 data science dilemma, data scientists spend 80% of their time with data preparation instead of applying their algorithms (&lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html" title="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html">https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html&lt;/a>). If Jupyterhub &amp;amp; other tools are correctly set up on top of a data lake this time can be drastically reduced, which includes using the right tools, latency reduction, and usage of the right storage version for the matching use case.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-is-etl--data-processing">What is ETL / Data Processing?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Another time-consuming step in data science is to take the data in its raw form (e.g. SQL data) and preprocess it into a form that makes it usable. This is called ETL, being short for Extract, Transform, Load. A good big data system automates these steps as best as possible, e.g. that to prepare data for the data scientists in the morning, huge cloud-driven machines start-up in the night, take the raw data, prepare it and save it ready to be analyzed in the morning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SQL databases can be a pain to manage. Additionally, many companies do not employ effective backup solutions in case a server goes down. More than often, unexpected traffic peaks can crash a product, because classic SQL servers do not scale with the demand needed. This can easily be avoided with the usage of cloud, or hybrid-cloud (on-premise and cloud) scenarios.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our focus when building websites is speed. BBC reported losing 10% of customers for every second their website takes to load.&lt;br>

Additionally, 53% of mobile users abandon the website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load (&lt;a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/" title="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/">https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/&lt;/a>).&lt;br>
Of course, the look and design of a website are important as well, but in the last years, looks became more important than loading times. The problem is, that if the website loads slowly the user will not even see your website. Therefore it is of uttermost importance to speed up websites because even apart from being favored by customers, they also rank higher on Google searches. We can do this using several serverless architectures, content delivery systems, and special settings to speed up content delivery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Financial Data-driven Planning</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/services/financial-data-driven-planning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 11:51:17 +0600</pubDate><author/><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/services/financial-data-driven-planning/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="financial-data-driven-planning">Financial Data-driven Planning&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Nowadays people become to understand the importance of data for their business. The only problem is, that many companies are overwhelmed by the amount of it, or do not have the &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-albanese/are-you-making-these-costly-data-analysis-mistakes.html">time or resources to take a deep-dive into the data.&lt;/a>&lt;br>
But using this data could bring enormous benefits in the form of saved costs, process improvements, increased advertisement efficiency, and generally increased sales.&lt;br>
According to a &lt;a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/">Forrester report&lt;/a>, 60 percent and 73 percent of all data within an enterprise is not used for analytics and remains stored on some hard drive never to be seen again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we are taking a look at your data our company follows two basic principles yielding vast improvements in your business:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="financial-planning-strategies">FINANCIAL PLANNING STRATEGIES&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="1-cost-reduction">1. Cost Reduction&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The first principle is cost reduction. We will take a look at your data to identify processes or areas where costs can be saved, or which areas could be optimized using either technology, HR, or delivery chain changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="2-increase-sales-and-revenue">2. Increase sales and revenue&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The second step includes identifying unseen opportunities in your data, or target demographics for your products that remain unseen in your data. This can include but is not limited to ad targeting, programmatic advertising, core customer identification, new sales channel generations, or increasing revenue of existing top sales channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="identifying-hidden-opportunities">Identifying hidden opportunities&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Combining and identifying all your available data is a complex task, consisting of analyzing whether your stored data can be processed at all given law and regulations, transforming them into a usable format, using the right tools to process big data, and finally almost most importantly visualizing and discussing the findings.&lt;br>
We do not simply do our reports in a black box sending you a final email, we rather understand that your business is complex and can only be analyzed using our data background and your business knowledge. Let us work together to solve these milestones on your journey to greater revenue and cost optimization&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, …)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creation of a data catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combining several sources to make the data usable (e.g. into a Data Lake)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access regulation and logging (security)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Application of Big Data tools where Excel can not work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working together to form a valid strategy for increased revenue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Training of staff to use the tools in the future&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building up your own Data department to reiterate these steps&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>We can use unlimited resources in the cloud to process your data, which we can transform into a one-time report or even a live-dashboard that updates itself. Depending on the use-case this can range from an automated Email report to stakeholders to a high-performance neural network model that updates calculations in e.g. Microsoft Power BI or other BI tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="company-growth">Company Growth&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Company growth is an important factor for young and established companies alike. To focus your precious and limited time on your most promising business fields is crucial, and can be identified in a workshop where we can take a look at your data. Identify your core customers, most promising business areas, or even new demographics and locations where your product promises new revenue streams.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="our-workflow--process">Our Workflow &amp;amp; Process&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Our workflow does not consist of a black-box model. We do not simply take your numbers, work on them blindly, and send you the final report. It is rather important to work together to unite our data knowledge and your business knowledge to craft the optimal solution iteratively. If wished-for, we will take care to train your department to utilize your new set of tools independently such that you stay a data-driven company.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working with an independent partner can have its benefits because your employees might be “trapped” in the box of their daily work. It can help a business a lot to take in external minds with a different approach to reveal new opportunities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our solutions are individual. Meaning we can help startups without many resources on a pay-per-sale basis or huge enterprises alike. Of course, an expensive Hadoop cluster costing thousands a month might not be the right solution for a new startup, and a standard dashboard might not be sufficient for an international enterprise. &lt;a href="https://datafortress.cloud/contact">contact us&lt;/a> and we will work out a scalable solution matching your resources.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Business Consulting</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/services/business-consulting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 15:51:35 +0600</pubDate><author/><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/services/business-consulting/</guid><description>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Being a lean startup ourselves we are experts in constantly rethinking our business using data, the newest tools, and trying new experimental business fields.&lt;br>
As a business owner, you might be thinking about how you could enhance, or speed up some processes, or increase the potential of your HR. We have worked with several different business fields and try to stay an agile company, therefore we might have experienced the perfect solution for your problems already.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h2 id="our-lean-business-approach">Our Lean Business Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>As a business in the area of new technology, a lean mindset is essential.&lt;br>
Enterprises oftentimes execute decisions affecting a large portion of their business without measuring the effect and minimizing damage.&lt;br>
The goal of a lean company is to take many small iterative steps, or prototypes before implementing a great change in the company and constantly measure and evaluate data.&lt;br>
For example, when implementing a new feature on our website we are doing A/B tests (showing x-percent of customers our page A, and x-percent of customers page B), measure values (in this case for example bounce rate and conversions) and finally decide if we should implement this feature or not – and all that in days.&lt;br>
If something does not work our business is not heavily affected, and we can pass on a new feature without huge losses, if it works, we can further enhance the feature or test it on a larger portion of our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process can be summarized into three simple steps, that are constantly running in an automated fashion:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/leanstartup.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="1-rethink-data-analytics">1. Rethink (Data Analytics)&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/bulb-1.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are new ways that your business could try? Are there hidden opportunities? New demographics? Should an area in your business be decreased in favour of another? The goal of this step is to formulate a goal or specific idea that will be tested in the next steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="2-execute">2. Execute&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/creators.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of a lean company is to stay flexible and try the ideas formulated beforehand as fast as possible. Measure the progress on the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="3-review--implement">3. Review &amp;amp; Implement&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/business-1.webp" alt="">&lt;br>
In this step, the data gathered before is analyzed, and if your measured value statistically significantly increased, the new feature is implemented and new ideas on top of this feature are generated (step 1).&lt;br>
Finally, the process starts again from the beginning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Customer Experience is becoming more and more important. The modern customer most likely researched your business online before contacting you, and sales are increasingly taking place in the online world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your goal is to reach the customer long before seeing him face-to-face.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>– Geoffrey Moore&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all business decisions nowadays are based on gut feeling. But more than often these decisions end up costing millions, and even if the company is not going bankrupt it is still missing out on a lot of unseen potentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uncover your hidden opportunities now and let us uncover treasures in your data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
