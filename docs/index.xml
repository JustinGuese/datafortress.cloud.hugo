&lt;h1 id="staying-compliant-with-german-data-protection-regulations-a-guide-for-enterprises">Staying Compliant with German Data Protection Regulations A Guide for Enterprises&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As data privacy regulations become increasingly strict, compliance with German data protection laws is more critical than ever. Enterprises operating in Germany must navigate a complex landscape of regulations to protect personal data and avoid the serious consequences of non-compliance. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of best practices for data protection in Germany and tips for ensuring compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-compliance-with-german-data-protection-regulations-is-critical-for-your-enterprise">Why Compliance with German Data Protection Regulations is Critical for Your Enterprise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compliance with German data protection regulations is critical for enterprises to protect the personal data of their customers and employees. Germany has a comprehensive legal framework that regulates the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of personal data, including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the European Union&amp;rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Non-compliance with these regulations can have significant consequences for businesses, including fines, legal action, damage to reputation, and loss of customer trust. The GDPR allows for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company&amp;rsquo;s global annual revenue, whichever is higher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To avoid these risks, enterprises must ensure compliance with German data protection regulations. This includes implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO), conducting regular risk assessments, and providing staff training on data protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, enterprises should document their compliance efforts, including policies and procedures for data protection, and maintain a breach response plan in case of a data breach. By taking a proactive approach to data protection and compliance, enterprises can protect their reputation and maintain the trust of their customers and employees.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-german-data-protection-regulations-every-enterprise-should-know">Key German Data Protection Regulations Every Enterprise Should Know&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To stay compliant with German data protection regulations, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for enterprises to have a solid understanding of the key laws and regulations that govern data privacy in Germany. In this segment, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the most important regulations that enterprises need to know, including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BDSG is the primary law that regulates data protection in Germany. It sets out rules and requirements for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data, and also outlines the rights that individuals have with respect to their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GDPR is an EU-wide regulation that has been implemented in Germany and sets out specific requirements for data protection that must be followed by all enterprises operating in the EU. It emphasizes the importance of obtaining valid consent from individuals for the collection and processing of their personal data, and also requires enterprises to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access or disclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other important regulations that enterprises should be aware of include the German Telemedia Act (TMG), which governs the collection and processing of personal data through electronic media, and the ePrivacy Regulation, which will replace the current ePrivacy Directive and provide additional rules for the processing of electronic communications data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By staying informed about these and other key regulations, enterprises can ensure that they are fully compliant with German data protection laws and avoid the potential risks and consequences of non-compliance, such as fines, legal action, and damage to reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices-for-ensuring-compliance-with-german-data-protection-regulations">Best Practices for Ensuring Compliance with German Data Protection Regulations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To ensure compliance with German data protection regulations, enterprises should follow best practices that focus on protecting personal data, being transparent about data collection and processing practices, and empowering individuals with respect to their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it is important to conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential data protection risks and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to mitigate them. Enterprises should also appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee compliance efforts and serve as a point of contact for individuals with questions or concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transparency is also key. Enterprises should draft clear and concise privacy policies that explain how personal data is collected, processed, and stored, as well as the purposes for which it is used. They should also obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting their personal data and provide them with the right to access and correct their data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, enterprises should have a breach response plan in place in case of a data breach. This plan should include procedures for detecting and reporting breaches, notifying affected individuals and authorities, and taking steps to prevent future breaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By following these best practices, enterprises can ensure compliance with German data protection regulations and protect the personal data of individuals, while also avoiding potential legal and reputational risks.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="kubernetes-deployment-strategies-what-are-the-best-practices-for-scaling-applications">Kubernetes deployment strategies: What are the best practices for scaling applications?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform that provides powerful and efficient mechanisms for deploying, managing, and scaling applications in the cloud. As such, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that Kubernetes has become one of the most popular solutions for companies looking to make their existing infrastructure both more robust and scalable. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at some ofthe best practices when it comes to deploying applications using a Kubernetes system, examining strategies from defining deployable resources to controlling access control. Read on to get started learning about how your company can leverage this versatile technology!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-kubernetes-and-what-are-its-benefits-for-scaling-applications">What is Kubernetes and what are its benefits for scaling applications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Kubernetes is an open-source system used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It&amp;rsquo;s offered by many cloud providers and its use is growing across industries. Kubernetes alleviates the pain associated with scaling applications at a large scale in a simple and efficient manner. Now businesses no longer have to worry about manually handling any extra capacity or wasting time managing automatic deployments. Kubernetes simplifies previously complex tasks like rolling updates, cluster scheduling, service discovery, application failover, and scalability by providing an automatable infrastructure layer. With its flexibility and ability to cope with quick changes in demand, it has proven itself totally invaluable for applications today.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-three-most-popular-kubernetes-deployment-strategies">The three most popular Kubernetes deployment strategies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Deploying applications to Kubernetes is an enticing proposition for many tech-savvy enterprises, as the platform can help make application management more efficient. With that said, it’s important to understand the best practices for deploying your cloud native software correctly. After all, a good deployment strategy can save your organization from potential security threats and costly downtime. Three of the most popular strategies for deploying applications on Kubernetes are direct deployment, auto-deployment, and rolling deployment. Each one offers different advantages and disadvantages that must be weighed before opting for that particular approach. As always, carefully evaluating these strategies according to your organization’s risks and needs will be critical if you want a successful application running on Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comparing-and-contrasting-the-three-strategies">Comparing and contrasting the three strategies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Docker and Kubernetes are powerful tools for deploying applications in the cloud. However, when it comes to selecting the best deployment strategy for an application, there are three distinct strategies to choose from: rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases. Rolling updates allow you to slowly introduce changes in your application by gradually replacing old nodes with new ones. On the other hand, blue-green deployments use two distinct sets of servers running different versions of the service in order to reduce downtime and increase reliability. Lastly, canary releases provide a way to deploy a new version of your code to a subset of users so that you can monitor their behavior before fully releasing the new version. You can make use of these strategies individually or mix them together depending on the nature and complexity of your project. Thus, understanding their features and implementation differences helps you to select an appropriate strategy for your deployment needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-best-practices-for-scaling-applications-with-kubernetes">The best practices for scaling applications with Kubernetes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Scaling applications with Kubernetes has become commonplace, due in part to the execution of the best practices involved. Rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases are key tactics that can be utilized to optimize your scaling efforts for any application running on Kubernetes. With rolling updates, you can incrementally deploy software across a cluster with no service interruption and test out upgrades/downgrades without incident. Blue-green deployments offer zero downtime as well, by having a production version (blue) and a testing version (green); features or bug fixes can be tested out on the green version before making them available in the production environment. Finally, Canary releases enable application developers to deploy versions of microservices directly to end users in a controlled manner in order to gather feedback before fully releasing it. Utilizing these best practices will ensure your scaling success when deploying applications with Kubernetes!

&lt;h1 id="why-would-you-use-docker-compose-over-kubernetes">Why would you use docker compose over kubernetes?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Are you looking for the best containerization solution for your business needs? While Kubernetes is often considered the industry standard, Docker Compose offers a lightweight, portable alternative with its own unique advantages. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll break down the pros and cons of each solution to help you make an informed decision for your container management needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="breaking-it-down-docker-compose-vs-kubernetes-for-container-management">Breaking it down: Docker Compose vs Kubernetes for container management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the management of multi-container applications. It allows developers to define a complex application as a single entity, making it easier to manage and deploy. With Docker Compose, you can define your application’s services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file. Docker Compose is best suited for small-scale deployments, and it’s a great choice if you want to keep things simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It’s designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and extensible, making it ideal for large-scale deployments. With Kubernetes, you can deploy and manage containers across multiple hosts, and it provides many features that are essential for production environments, such as load balancing, auto-scaling, and self-healing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main difference between Docker Compose and Kubernetes is the scope of their functionality. Docker Compose is designed to manage small-scale deployments, whereas Kubernetes is designed to manage large-scale deployments. While Docker Compose is easy to set up and use, it lacks some of the advanced features that Kubernetes provides, such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. Kubernetes, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve and requires more setup and maintenance, but it offers a much more powerful set of features that are essential for large-scale deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-docker-compose-is-a-viable-alternative-to-kubernetes">Why Docker Compose is a viable alternative to Kubernetes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Docker Compose and Kubernetes are two popular container management tools, and while Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container orchestration, Docker Compose still has its own unique advantages that make it a viable alternative for certain use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main benefits of Docker Compose is its simplicity. Unlike Kubernetes, which requires a more complex setup and configuration, Docker Compose provides an easy way to define and run multi-container Docker applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Docker Compose is also more lightweight than Kubernetes, making it a great option for smaller projects that don&amp;rsquo;t require the extensive features and scalability of Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, while Kubernetes is a powerful tool for container management, Docker Compose is a viable alternative for smaller projects or those who value simplicity and ease of use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose you have a simple web application with a web server and a database, and you want to run it in Docker Compose. Here is an example docker-compose.yml file that you can use:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>version: &amp;#39;3&amp;#39;
services:
web:
build: .
ports:
- &amp;#34;8000:8000&amp;#34;
db:
image: postgres
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>In this example, the docker-compose.yml file defines two services: web and db. The web service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory, and exposes port 8000. The db service uses the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose you have the same web application as before, and you want to deploy it in Kubernetes. Here is an example deployment.yml file that you can use:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: web
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: web
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: web
spec:
containers:
- name: web
image: myapp:latest
ports:
- containerPort: 8000
- name: db
image: postgres:latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>In this example, the deployment.yml file defines a deployment with three replicas of the web service, and a single replica of the db service. The web service uses an image called myapp:latest, which is assumed to be hosted in a container registry somewhere. The db service uses the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-using-docker-compose-vs-kubernetes-for-your-container-needs">The pros and cons of using Docker Compose vs Kubernetes for your container needs&lt;/h2>

&lt;h1 id="maximizing-cost-savings-in-the-cloud-how-to-run-kubernetes-without-a-load-balancer">Maximizing Cost Savings in the Cloud: How to Run Kubernetes without a Load Balancer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When it comes to running Kubernetes in the cloud, one of the most significant costs can come from using a load balancer for each service. With prices starting at around $15 per month per load balancer, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for costs to quickly add up, especially if you have a large number of pods. However, what if we told you that there&amp;rsquo;s a way to run Kubernetes without the need for a load balancer and still get the benefits of high availability and automatic failover? In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how you can achieve cost savings in the cloud by running Kubernetes without a load balancer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="version-1-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-to-just-use-one-load-balancer">Version 1: Nginx Ingress with Cert Manager to just use one Load Balancer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One cost-saving strategy is to use only one load balancer for the entire cluster, rather than a separate load balancer for each service. This can be achieved by using an &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/">Nginx Ingress&lt;/a>, which acts as a single entry point for all external traffic to the cluster. The Nginx Ingress then distributes the traffic to the appropriate pods based on the domain name, instead of creating one load balancer per service.
The best part: If you are adding &lt;a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/">cert manager&lt;/a>, you will get free LetsEncrypt SSL certificates!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to deploy the Nginx Ingress in your cluster, is by using Helm:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
--repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
--namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>After that, to ensure https and SSL running for your services, you need to deploy Cert Manager with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>helm install \
cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
--namespace cert-manager \
--create-namespace \
--set installCRDs=true
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Then, you need to create a &amp;ldquo;ClusterIssuer&amp;rdquo; in order to tell LetsEncrypt who you are. Create a file &amp;ldquo;clusterissuer.yaml&amp;rdquo; with the content adapted to your Email:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
acme:
server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
#change to your email
email: EMAIL
privateKeySecretRef:
name: letsencrypt-prod
solvers:
- http01:
ingress:
class: nginx # public or nginx depending on version
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>After that, apply it to your cluster with &lt;code>kubectl apply -f clusterissuer.yaml&lt;/code> and you are set up!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-an-ingress">Creating an Ingress&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now, you need to grab the name of your service that you want to expose to the world. You can get it with &lt;code>kubectl get service&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, let&amp;rsquo;s assume your service is named &amp;ldquo;nginx&amp;rdquo; in the default namespace. To route your domain &amp;ldquo;test.datafortress.cloud&amp;rdquo; to it, you need to create the following testdf-ingress.yaml:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: ingress-nginx-test
namespace: default
annotations:
cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: &amp;#34;letsencrypt-prod&amp;#34;
spec:
tls:
- hosts:
#change to your domain
- test.datafortress.cloud
secretName: tls-secret
rules:
#change to your domain
- host: test.datafortress.cloud
http:
paths:
- path: /
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: nginx
port:
number: 80
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Apply it with &lt;code>kubectl apply -f testdf-ingress.yaml&lt;/code>, and point the domain you used to the load balancer used by your node. Soon you should see it spin up in your cluster, and see your service at the domain you stated in the ingress.
To debug, have a look at the nginx pod or certificates.

&lt;p>While this solution may save you money on your cloud bill, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that using no load balancers can come with its own set of challenges. For example, if a node fails, the traffic won&amp;rsquo;t be automatically routed to a healthy server, leading to downtime for your service. In many cases, having a load balancer is still the best option as it provides automatic failover and ensures that your services remain available to your customers. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to weigh the cost savings against the potential risks and make an informed decision on the best solution for your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="version-2-saving-even-more-money-with-0-load-balancers">Version 2: Saving even more money with 0 load balancers!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to save even more money on your cloud bill, there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative to the above solution that uses no load balancers at all! Instead of using Nginx Ingress, this solution utilizes the nodePorts 80 and 443 on the server to redirect traffic to the appropriate pods. This eliminates the need for any load balancers, which can significantly reduce your cloud costs. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the details of this solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, we will upgrade our existing nginx ingress to use NodePorts instead of Load Balancers:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
--namespace ingress-nginx \
--create-namespace \
--set controller.service.type=NodePort \
--set controller.service.ports.http=80 \
--set service.annotations.&amp;#34;metallb.universe.tf/address-pool&amp;#34;=singlenode \
--set controller.service.ports.https=443
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You should soon see your ingress-nginx service to switch to Nodeport, and the load balancer should disappear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While using load balancers provides stability to a cluster, it is a legitimate way to save money with one-node Kubernetes distributions. By eliminating the need for load balancers and relying solely on the node ports 80 and 443, you can reduce your monthly costs significantly. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep in mind that not having a load balancer also means that in case of a failing node, the traffic will not be automatically routed to a healthy server. If you are operating a one-node Kubernetes distribution, this trade-off between stability and cost savings is worth considering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="verdict-is-it-worth-it">Verdict: Is it worth it?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In conclusion, there are multiple ways to save costs in your Kubernetes cluster, from using only one load balancer with nginx ingress to using 0 load balancers and relying on nodeports. While a load balancer has its benefits in terms of stability and ensuring traffic routing, there are alternatives that can help reduce costs. If you&amp;rsquo;re still unsure of the best way to save money in your Kubernetes cluster, &lt;a href="https://datafortress.cloud/contact">consider taking advantage of the cost-effective shared Kubernetes clusters offered by DataFortress.cloud, or seek our assistance in managing your cluster costs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Private Clouds: Comparing the Top Providers and Their Offerings</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/blog/private-cloud-providers-comparison/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 07:10:46 +0200</pubDate><author>Justin Guese</author><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/blog/private-cloud-providers-comparison/</guid><description>

&lt;h1 id="key-legal-considerations-for-data-processing-in-germany-an-overview-for-enterprises">Key Legal Considerations for Data Processing in Germany An Overview for Enterprises&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, data processing has become a crucial part of many business operations, and it&amp;rsquo;s essential for enterprises to be aware of the legal framework surrounding this. In this article, we provide an overview of key legal considerations for data processing in Germany, including consent, retention, and data protection regulations. We also discuss the potential risks of non-compliance and provide tips on how enterprises can ensure they are processing data in accordance with the law.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="navigating-data-processing-laws-in-germany-a-comprehensive-guide-for-enterprises">Navigating Data Processing Laws in Germany: A Comprehensive Guide for Enterprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Navigating data processing laws in Germany can be a complex and challenging task for enterprises. To ensure compliance with the law, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of data protection regulations, recent changes, and compliance best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step to navigating data processing laws in Germany is to understand the basics of data protection. This includes understanding what personal data is and what constitutes data processing. Enterprises must also be aware of their obligations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been implemented in Germany.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, enterprises must comply with various other German data protection laws, such as the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the Telecommunications Act (TKG), and the Telemedia Act (TMG). These laws set out specific rules regarding the collection, use, and processing of personal data, as well as data transfer and storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure compliance with these laws, enterprises must implement a comprehensive data protection and compliance program. This should include conducting regular data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO), and implementing technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enterprises must also ensure that they obtain appropriate consents from individuals for data processing activities and provide them with clear and concise information about the collection and processing of their personal data. Additionally, enterprises must be transparent about data sharing and transfer practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also essential for enterprises to stay up-to-date with the latest regulations and compliance best practices. This can involve attending relevant training courses and seminars, as well as working with data protection experts to stay informed about changes in the law.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-legal-obligations-key-considerations-for-data-processing-in-germany">Understanding Legal Obligations: Key Considerations for Data Processing in Germany&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When it comes to data processing in Germany, there are several key legal considerations that enterprises need to keep in mind. First and foremost, the European Union&amp;rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all businesses that handle the personal data of EU citizens, including those in Germany. Additionally, the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) sets out specific requirements for data processing, including the need for informed consent, data minimization, and the right to erasure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure compliance with these regulations, enterprises must obtain informed consent from individuals before collecting their personal data. They must also minimize the amount of data collected and ensure that it is used only for the specific purposes for which it was collected. Individuals have the right to request the erasure of their personal data, and enterprises must comply with such requests unless there is a legitimate reason not to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, enterprises must ensure that they have appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. They must also appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if they process large amounts of sensitive personal data or engage in systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By understanding these legal obligations and taking appropriate steps to comply with them, enterprises can protect the personal data of their customers and employees and avoid costly fines and reputational damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compliance-is-key-legal-considerations-for-data-processing-in-germany">Compliance is Key: Legal Considerations for Data Processing in Germany&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compliance with data processing laws is crucial for businesses operating in Germany, as failure to comply can result in significant legal and financial consequences.
Here are some key considerations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): The GDPR applies to all EU member states, including Germany, and governs the processing of personal data. Enterprises must adhere to its principles and requirements, such as obtaining valid consent, informing individuals about their data processing activities, and implementing appropriate security measures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG): The BDSG is the main data protection law in Germany and sets out additional requirements that enterprises must follow, such as appointing a data protection officer (DPO) for certain types of data processing activities and obtaining specific types of consent for certain types of data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Telemedia Act (TMG): The TMG governs data protection for electronic communication services and imposes specific obligations, such as obtaining specific consent for certain types of data processing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social Security Code (SGB): The SGB regulates data processing for social security purposes and sets out specific requirements for data processing, such as limiting the use of data to specific purposes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To ensure compliance with these laws, enterprises must implement various best practices, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conducting a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) to identify potential risks and compliance issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implementing technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to ensure the security of personal data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Appointing a DPO to oversee data protection practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maintaining up-to-date documentation of data processing activities and ensuring transparency and accountability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Providing individuals with clear and concise information about their data processing activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Overall, compliance with legal considerations for data processing in Germany is key to avoid legal issues and maintain customer trust. Enterprises should understand the relevant laws, follow best practices, and stay up-to-date with changes and updates to ensure ongoing compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="from-consent-to-retention-a-comprehensive-overview-of-data-processing-laws-in-germany">From Consent to Retention: A Comprehensive Overview of Data Processing Laws in Germany&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data processing laws in Germany cover every aspect of how organizations handle personal data. These laws define the types of data that can be processed, how the data can be collected, how long it can be stored, and how it can be shared. It&amp;rsquo;s critical for enterprises to understand these laws and ensure compliance with them to protect the privacy rights of their customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One key legal consideration for data processing in Germany is obtaining valid consent from individuals for collecting, processing, and sharing their personal data. Another critical consideration is the retention period for personal data, which should not exceed what is necessary for the specific purpose for which the data was collected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also essential to ensure that personal data is processed in accordance with the principles of data protection, such as purpose limitation, data minimization, and confidentiality. Organizations must also take measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access and misuse.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As businesses collect increasing amounts of personal data from their customers and employees, having a comprehensive privacy policy in place is more important than ever. In Germany, businesses are required to comply with strict privacy laws, which makes crafting an effective privacy policy critical for ensuring compliance. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on the key components that German privacy policies should include and offer tips for drafting a clear and effective policy that can help protect your enterprise and its customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-importance-of-privacy-policies-for-german-enterprises">Understanding the Importance of Privacy Policies for German Enterprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Privacy policies are essential for enterprises in Germany, as they help to establish trust with customers and protect their personal data. In this segment, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the importance of privacy policies and the key components that German enterprises need to include in their policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, privacy policies can help to ensure that enterprises comply with relevant laws and regulations in Germany, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is important because failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines and legal consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, privacy policies can help to build trust with customers by demonstrating that the enterprise takes data protection seriously. This can be particularly important for enterprises that handle sensitive personal data, such as healthcare providers or financial institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When creating a privacy policy, German enterprises should include several key components. These include information about the types of personal data that are collected, how the data is used, and who it is shared with. The policy should also outline the measures that are taken to protect the data, such as encryption, access controls, and data backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these components, the privacy policy should provide information about how customers can access and update their personal data, as well as how they can request that their data be deleted. The policy should also include details about how customers can contact the enterprise with any questions or concerns about data privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, privacy policies are a crucial component of data protection for German enterprises. By including all the necessary components in their policies, enterprises can demonstrate their commitment to data privacy and build trust with their customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-components-of-german-privacy-policies-a-comprehensive-guide">Key Components of German Privacy Policies: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A comprehensive and well-written privacy policy is a critical component of any business&amp;rsquo;s data protection strategy in Germany. Not only is it legally required under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but it can also help build trust with customers and enhance the reputation of the business. Here are some key components that should be included in a German privacy policy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Types of personal data collected: The privacy policy should clearly outline the types of personal data that the business collects, such as names, addresses, email addresses, or other information that is relevant to the business.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purposes for collecting data: It&amp;rsquo;s important to explain the reasons for collecting personal data. This includes what the data will be used for, how it will be processed, and who will have access to it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data protection and security measures: A privacy policy should describe how the business protects personal data, such as encryption or other security measures, and how it ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data subject rights: The privacy policy should also include information on data subject rights, such as the right to access, rectify, or delete personal data. It should also outline the procedures for exercising these rights.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Legal basis for data processing: The privacy policy should explain the legal basis for data processing, whether it is based on consent, legitimate interest, or other legal grounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When drafting a privacy policy, it&amp;rsquo;s important to use clear and concise language that is easily understandable for the average reader. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to be transparent about data collection and processing practices and to avoid using overly broad or vague language. Including contact information for a Data Protection Officer (DPO) is also recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="crafting-an-effective-privacy-policy-for-your-german-enterprise">Crafting an Effective Privacy Policy for Your German Enterprise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a German enterprise, having a clear and effective privacy policy is essential to comply with data protection laws and build trust with customers. Your privacy policy should clearly communicate what personal data is collected, how it is processed, and what rights individuals have with respect to their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To craft an effective privacy policy, start by conducting a data inventory to identify what personal data your enterprise collects and processes. This may include data from employees, customers, and partners. Once you have identified the data, consider the purposes for which it is used, such as to provide services, communicate with customers, or conduct marketing activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, clearly communicate your data processing practices in your privacy policy. This should include information on how data is collected, processed, and stored, as well as any third parties who may have access to the data. Be transparent about the legal basis for processing the data, such as consent or legitimate interests, and provide details on how long the data will be retained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure your privacy policy is effective, it&amp;rsquo;s important to use clear and simple language that is easy for individuals to understand. Avoid using technical jargon or legal language that can confuse readers. Be transparent about how individuals can exercise their data protection rights, such as the right to access, rectify, or delete their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, include contact information for a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in your privacy policy. The DPO is responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection laws and can answer any questions individuals may have about their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crafting an effective privacy policy can be a complex process, but it is essential for ensuring compliance with data protection laws and building trust with customers.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="ensuring-data-privacy-for-german-customers-a-guide-for-enterprises">Ensuring Data Privacy for German Customers: A Guide for Enterprises&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, data privacy is more important than ever, particularly for businesses that operate in Germany. German customers are increasingly concerned about how their personal information is being collected, stored, and used by enterprises. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to help businesses ensure data privacy for their German customers. We will discuss the importance of data privacy, best practices for ensuring compliance, and how to build trust with your customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-data-privacy-for-german-customers-should-be-a-top-priority-for-enterprises">Why Data Privacy for German Customers Should Be a Top Priority for Enterprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data privacy for German customers should be a top priority for enterprises, and there are several reasons why this is the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, data privacy is essential for building customer trust. In Germany, data protection is taken very seriously, and customers are likely to be more loyal to companies that they believe are taking steps to protect their personal information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, maintaining compliance with data protection laws is essential for enterprises. German data protection laws are among the strictest in the world, and non-compliance can result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage. Companies that fail to protect their customers&amp;rsquo; data may face legal action, which can be costly and time-consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirdly, data breaches can result in significant reputational damage. German customers are increasingly aware of the risks of data breaches, and they are likely to take their business elsewhere if they feel that a company is not taking data privacy seriously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To demonstrate their commitment to data privacy, enterprises can implement data protection measures, such as encryption and access controls. They can also provide transparent privacy policies that clearly explain how personal data is collected, stored, and used. This will help customers to make informed decisions about sharing their personal information and will build trust between the enterprise and its customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, data privacy for German customers should be a top priority for enterprises. By demonstrating their commitment to data privacy, companies can build customer trust, maintain compliance with data protection laws, and avoid reputational damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-legal-framework-german-data-privacy-laws-and-regulations">Understanding the Legal Framework: German Data Privacy Laws and Regulations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The primary law governing data privacy in Germany is the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG). This law governs the processing, storage, and use of personal data by both public and private entities. The BDSG sets out strict requirements for data collection, processing, and storage, as well as the rights of individuals to access, modify, or delete their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another critical piece of legislation is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is an EU-wide regulation that was implemented in 2018. The GDPR builds on the principles of the BDSG and provides additional protections for individuals&amp;rsquo; personal data, including the right to be forgotten and the right to data portability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these laws, there are several other regulations and guidelines that govern data privacy in Germany. These include the Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz or TMG), which regulates the collection and use of personal data in electronic communication, and the ePrivacy Directive, which sets out rules for electronic communication privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Government Agencies:
Several government agencies in Germany are responsible for enforcing data privacy laws and regulations. The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) is an independent agency responsible for protecting personal data and ensuring that individuals&amp;rsquo; rights to privacy are respected. The BfDI investigates data breaches and can impose fines on organizations that violate data privacy laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community (BMI) is also responsible for data protection and cybersecurity policies. The BMI works with other government agencies, industry groups, and international organizations to develop best practices for data protection and promote cybersecurity awareness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices-for-ensuring-data-privacy-for-german-customers">Best Practices for Ensuring Data Privacy for German Customers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Protecting the data privacy of German customers is a top priority for enterprises operating in the country. To ensure compliance with data protection regulations and build trust with customers, businesses must implement best practices for data privacy. Here are some tips for ensuring data privacy for German customers:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Implement data protection measures: To secure customer data, implement technical and organizational measures such as encryption, access controls, and firewalls to protect against unauthorized access or data breaches. Regularly review and update these measures to ensure they remain effective.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conduct regular security audits: Perform regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and potential risks to customer data. Address any issues that are identified promptly and proactively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO): If your business handles large amounts of customer data, consider appointing a DPO to oversee data privacy practices and ensure compliance with data protection laws.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transparency in privacy policies: Provide clear and concise information in your privacy policies about the types of customer data you collect, how the data is used and stored, and who it is shared with. It is essential to be transparent about data processing practices to build customer trust.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obtain customer consent: Obtain explicit consent from customers before collecting and processing their data. Provide them with the ability to opt-out of data sharing or request the deletion of their personal information.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By implementing these best practices, businesses can ensure they are compliant with German data protection regulations and build trust with their customers. Enterprises should demonstrate their commitment to data privacy to their German customers by prioritizing the protection of their personal data and being transparent about their data collection, storage, and processing practices.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of the project is to build a data landscape from existing and future data, which can then be used to better understand business processes and make automatic data-driven recommendations and decisions using machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A particular challenge was the handling of sensitive patient data, which is why the requirements of the German Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) and the Baden-Würtemberg Hospital IT Act had to be met.
Therefore, the first phase of the project consisted of planning and close coordination with several law firms to work out and plan the specifications of the hospital laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial architecture was serverless built on AWS, but was then redesigned to Kubernetes due to legal decisions regarding medical data. High data security was a requirement, as highly sensitive medical data is used and analyzed, which requires ISO certification and managing HL7 data.
I then deployed a BareMetal Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud with K3s, Terraform and MicroOS, which autoscales horizontally, load balances and automatically creates certificates (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)">https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)&lt;/a>. The cluster and deployment are continuously monitored and errors are automatically fixed. In addition to the security aspects, it further allows us to save 90% in costs compared to AWS EKS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the area of analytics, we created a dashboard for NoSQL and SQL data, as well as ETL pipelines to create a data warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Machine Learning, one goal was to run highly scalable models in the cloud to make decisions and classify customers and app users in Milliseconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to improve the customer journey, a &amp;ldquo;profile&amp;rdquo; was created for each custom, followed by manual analysis, classification using data science, and twin-customer analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was hired by HPE for the BMW project to support HPE in the area of public cloud.
Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t give any details due to the NDA, but
HPE will use their own servers on site to cache a local copy of the data, but then using direct connections to the public cloud in reference to different storage classes, the data will be stored deduplicated in multiple public clouds. The whole system is continuously monitored and started using scheduling tools. A lot of custom Linux programming was required for this project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal was to process livestreams of tick stock market data in milliseconds and give decisions regarding trading strategies. In the further course, an automated trading bot was developed, which makes buying decisions based on machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In detail, ~120 tick data/seconds were processed, which were sent to Apache Kafka (meanwhile Flink) and then processed by autoscaling microservices (AWS Lambda). The model itself was hosted using OpenFAAS in a Docker Swarm cluster and performed purchase decisions via custom APIs to ASX.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal of the project is to create a cloud architecture and software that collects information about potential customers and writes to them with a very personalized message on LinkedIn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this purpose, first a web scraper was set up, which searches LinkedIn, Twitter and Google for information about the potential contact, and interprets this information using NLP machine learning and creates a &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; per customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A personalized cover letter is then generated using another NLP model, and another Selenium Python bot is used to send the message to the customer via LinkedIn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the software and models have to handle thousands of requests within a few Seconds, it was necessary to develop an autoscaling and fast architecture using Docker and AWS ECS, which at the same time does not incur too many costs due to GPU instances on AWS. The final architecture is a mix of Docker microservices and Spot instances that host the GPU Docker images on demand.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal was to combine various NoSQL and SQL databases in a central data warehouse and data lake.
Data had to be collected via batch jobs in a nightly process as well as &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; data via streaming using Kafka from different end devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A special requirement of the project was that large amounts of data had to be managed (20+ million web events / month, 2 TB/month), as well as the security standards had to be met by Volkswagen AG. Along with this, I was also massively involved in the implementation of the DSGVO standards, as well as with the group-wide &amp;ldquo;Team Cloud&amp;rdquo; from Volkswagen AG in the expansion of the cloud infrastructure with AWS and MS Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various recommender systems were developed for use in apps and on websites, with the aim of displaying the perfect vehicle for a user. These were implemented in a simple way using graphs in Elasticsearch, and in more complex scenarios using precomputed clusters or machine learning models which were played out using OpenFAAS and Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, machine learning models were developed for the prediction of unit numbers, inventories and (vehicle) registration numbers.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="going-from-wordpress-to-serverless-unhackable-high-speed-static-websites">Going from Wordpress to serverless, unhackable high-speed static websites&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I have been building websites in the past, but have always been struggling with the slow performance of WordPress. If it is loaded with plugins, it will need quite some resources and can be a pain if you are just developing an idea on a small server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, safety is of concern as well, and as a system that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">33,6% of websites are using&lt;/a>, it is quite attractive for hackers to find exploits and other issues in it.
But again, as it is massively popular, there is almost every time a plugin for the issues you are having, which makes it easy to use, and a great &amp;ldquo;all-in-one&amp;rdquo; tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="idea-1-improving-wordpress-development">Idea 1: Improving WordPress Development&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the first things I did in the past has been to develop WordPress locally (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/wordpress-local-development-beginners-setup-deployment/">see this AWS post&lt;/a>), and then just publish the result on a server. Programming and writing speeds increased enormously, but the uploading part proved to be a problem, as WordPress links are usually &amp;ldquo;hardwired&amp;rdquo; into the SQL database it uses. Meaning all my links were referring to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.datafotress.cloud">https://www.datafotress.cloud&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (My Computer) instead of the target domain. There are ways to solve this, like rewriting your URLs in SQL, or using rewriting htaccess rules to refer &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; URLs to the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; ones, but still, it was a lot of struggle to get going.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="idea-2-online-development-with-offloaded-media-files">Idea 2: Online Development with Offloaded Media files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This URL rewriting issue got on my nerves real quick, and local development is bad for multiple developers. That is why I decided to &amp;ldquo;go online&amp;rdquo; again, and work &amp;ldquo;with the cloud&amp;rdquo;. The architecture I followed has been to deploy one development server, that is only accessible to developers, and to upload media files to shared storage (AWS S3) from which end users are pulling the media files. As media files (pictures, videos, &amp;hellip;) are the most demanding parts of WordPress, speed increased drastically, and additionally, it has been easy to set up a CDN on top of it, which basically means the media files are deployed all over the world at unlimited capacity (basically serverless). This means, that one user in e.g. Puerto Rico does not need to access my server in Frankfurt, but has a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; copy close to him. Additionally, as the &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo; part of WordPress has been &amp;ldquo;outsourced&amp;rdquo;, only &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; servers were needed to handle PHP requests and the &amp;ldquo;back-office&amp;rdquo; parts of WordPress. Feel free to ask me more about it in the comments or a direct message, or &lt;a href="https://devops.com/hosting-scalable-wordpress-on-aws/">check out a similar approach by AWS&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/blog/Webp.net-resizeimage.png" alt="Architecture for wordpress on AWS">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together with Autoscaling, this seemed to be the most ideal setup for WordPress, and it proved great. BUT&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You still had to check for Plugin Updates, Security, and Monitoring in general. Even though AWS helps a lot to make this architecture quite resilient and fast, there is still a high operational demand. Additionally, running a separate development, database, load balancing, and so on the server can be quite cost expensive, especially for a website that does not have many users.
And what did Werner Vogels say at re:invent 2015?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;No server is easier to manage than no server&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Werner Vogels at re:invent 2015&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="excursion-a-brief-history-of-the-code-of-web">Excursion: A brief history of the Code of web&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>WordPress is great for writers and editors, but form the perspective of a solution architect it is not great. Why? Even though everything is clickable, easy to handle, and so on, all resources and information are pulled from a database in the background, even though if it is pulled for the 100000th time this day. There are methods to reduce the query load on SQL databases, like Redis and Memcached, but why should I &amp;ldquo;calculate&amp;rdquo; the same webpage for every single user? &amp;ldquo;Back in the day&amp;rdquo;, websites did just load in seconds (except someone has been on the phone) and they were super small - what has changed? Together with new design demands, today&amp;rsquo;s websites are full of effects and designs that are heavy on computational resources. Even though this is definitely an improvement to the 90s black and white style, loading times of websites increased dramatically - especially as the world&amp;rsquo;s connection standard is still mobile network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To render all the effects, PHP code is used in the background, which is code executed on the server itself. Meaning every time a user connects to a website, the server is calculating the website it is going to show to the user. The 90s version of websites featured just plain HTML code, which are basically simple instructions to the browser on how to handle things. Like the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag tells the browser this is a heading, and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a paragraph. No (sorry for reducing complexity!) calculations are needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, Javascript and CSS go a similar path as CSS describes design in a similar approach to HTML, and Javascript is executed not on the server, but on the client-side. Meaning the server does not calculate itself, but &amp;ldquo;sends instructions&amp;rdquo; to the client&amp;rsquo;s browser (e.g. your phone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why don&amp;rsquo;t we use just HTML, Javascript, and CSS? PHP enables us to do a lot of things and allows for content creation frameworks like WordPress to make our lives easier. But the efficient way to produce websites would be to generate them once and then just distribute them already rendered to the masses.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="idea-4-going-back-to-the-roots">Idea 4: Going back to the roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So am I saying we should go back to the black and white HTML pages of the 90s? Of course not, but the combination of HTML and CSS can produce great results, and Javascript becomes more and more capable to handle processes only PHP could handle in the past. And if calculations are needed, there are great new serverless possibilities available like AWS Lambda (check out my blog for some applications of Lambda).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going back to the main topic, I have decided to write my blog and any future websites in plain HTML, CSS, and JS, as I do not need to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>manage a server&lt;/strong> - I can just host it for almost free on Github or AWS S3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>worry about high-demands&lt;/strong> - S3 and Github scale automatically, meaning if thousands of visitors arrive on my website it will not crash my server
pay much - as I do not need as many calculations as with WordPress, running this blog is completely free&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>do not need to worry about security issues&lt;/strong> - my blog is basically unhackable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Additionally, the website is blazingly fast, with a Google Pagespeed score of 100%, which has a great effect on page ranking as well, as Google favors high-speed websites. The only reason why the current score is down to 90%, is that I decided to include CRM and tracking tools on my blog. When was the last time you saw a free website achieving this score?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it is just great, but am I writing all the HTML code by myself?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introducing-static-website-generators">Introducing: Static Website Generators&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of course not, and luckily there are great tools to handle this for me. Static website builders like &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> help a lot to let you basically just type in Markdown language (basically a simple txt file) and convert your texts into HTML and a nice website. The code is just calculated once and can be uploaded to a server, or Github pages and AWS S3 right away to be completely serverless. &lt;a href="https://datafortress.cloud/project/serverless-static-website/">How does it work? Check out my case studies on my blog for an in-depth explanation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It feels great to not worry about uptime, scaling, and security anymore. Is it harder than WordPress? It depends. As this technology just develops, there is a rethinking to be done if you worked with WordPress and others in the past, but again there are many great tools that make static website builders similar to the &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; WordPress environment, like forestry.io for example. How? &lt;a href="https://datafortress.cloud/project/serverless-static-website/">Check out my blog at www.datafortress.cloud to see the in-depth explanation&lt;/a>.

&lt;h1 id="what-is-mtcnn">What is MTCNN&lt;/h1>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>MTCNN is a python (pip) library written by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn">Github user ipacz&lt;/a>, which implements the [paper Zhang, Kaipeng et al. “Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks.” IEEE Signal Processing Letters 23.10 (2016): 1499–1503. Crossref. Web](&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878%5D(https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878%20%22https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)">https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878%5D(https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878%20%22https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this paper, they propose a deep cascaded multi-task framework using different features of “sub-models” to each boost their correlating strengths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MTCNN performs quite fast on a CPU, even though S3FD is still quicker running on a GPU – but that is a topic for another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post uses code from the following two sources, check them out, they are interesting as well:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;h1 id="basic-usage-of-mtcnn">Basic usage of MTCNN&lt;/h1>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Feel free to access the whole notebook via:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/mtcnn-face-extraction-eyes-mouth-nose-and-speeding-it-up" title="https://github.com/JustinGuese/mtcnn-face-extraction-eyes-mouth-nose-and-speeding-it-up">https://github.com/JustinGuese/mtcnn-face-extraction-eyes-mouth-nose-and-speeding-it-up&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>git clone https://github.com/JustinGuese/mtcnn-face-extraction-eyes-mouth-nose-and-speeding-it-up
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Luckily MTCNN is available as a pip package, meaning we can easily install it using&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>pip install mtcnn
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now switching to Python/Jupyter Notebook we can check the installation with an import and quick verification:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>import mtcnn
# print version
print(mtcnn.__version__)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Afterwards, we are ready to load out test image using the matplotlib &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2vo3INw">imread function&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# load image from file
filename = &amp;quot;glediston-bastos-ZtmmR9D_2tA-unsplash.webp&amp;quot;
pixels = plt.imread(filename)
print(&amp;quot;Shape of image/array:&amp;quot;,pixels.shape)
imgplot = plt.imshow(pixels)
plt.show()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now your output will look a lot like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{'box': [1942, 716, 334, 415], 'confidence': 0.9999997615814209, 'keypoints': {'left_eye': (2053, 901), 'right_eye': (2205, 897), 'nose': (2139, 976), 'mouth_left': (2058, 1029), 'mouth_right': (2206, 1023)}}
{'box': [2084, 396, 37, 46], 'confidence': 0.9999206066131592, 'keypoints': {'left_eye': (2094, 414), 'right_eye': (2112, 414), 'nose': (2102, 426), 'mouth_left': (2095, 432), 'mouth_right': (2112, 431)}}
{'box': [1980, 381, 44, 59], 'confidence': 0.9998701810836792, 'keypoints': {'left_eye': (1997, 404), 'right_eye': (2019, 407), 'nose': (2010, 417), 'mouth_left': (1995, 425), 'mouth_right': (2015, 427)}}
{'box': [2039, 395, 39, 46], 'confidence': 0.9993435740470886, 'keypoints': {'left_eye': (2054, 409), 'right_eye': (2071, 415), 'nose': (2058, 422), 'mouth_left': (2048, 425), 'mouth_right': (2065, 431)}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>What does this tell us? A lot of it is self-explanatory, but it basically returns coordinates, or the pixel values of a rectangle where the MTCNN algorithm detected faces. The “box” value above returns the location of the whole face, followed by a “confidence” level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to do more advanced extractions or algorithms, you will have access to other facial landmarks, called “keypoints” as well. Namely the MTCNN model located the eyes, mouth and nose as well!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="drawing-a-box-around-faces">Drawing a box around faces&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>To demonstrate this even better let us draw a box around the face using matplotlib:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># draw an image with detected objects
def draw_facebox(filename, result_list):
# load the image
data = plt.imread(filename)
# plot the image
plt.imshow(data)
# get the context for drawing boxes
ax = plt.gca()
# plot each box
for result in result_list:
# get coordinates
x, y, width, height = result['box']
# create the shape
rect = plt.Rectangle((x, y), width, height, fill=False, color='green')
# draw the box
ax.add_patch(rect)
# show the plot
plt.show()
# filename = 'test1.webp' # filename is defined above, otherwise uncomment
# load image from file
# pixels = plt.imread(filename) # defined above, otherwise uncomment
# detector is defined above, otherwise uncomment
#detector = mtcnn.MTCNN()
# detect faces in the image
faces = detector.detect_faces(pixels)
# display faces on the original image
draw_facebox(filename, faces)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;h2 id="displaying-eyes-mouth-and-nose-around-faces">Displaying eyes, mouth, and nose around faces&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Now let us take a look at the aforementioned “keypoints” that the MTCNN model returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will now use these to graph the nose, mouth, and eyes as well.&lt;br>
We will add the following code snippet to our code above:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># draw the dots
for key, value in result['keypoints'].items():
# create and draw dot
dot = plt.Circle(value, radius=20, color='orange')
ax.add_patch(dot)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>With the full code from above looking like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># draw an image with detected objects
def draw_facebox(filename, result_list):
# load the image
data = plt.imread(filename)
# plot the image
plt.imshow(data)
# get the context for drawing boxes
ax = plt.gca()
# plot each box
for result in result_list:
# get coordinates
x, y, width, height = result['box']
# create the shape
rect = plt.Rectangle((x, y), width, height,fill=False, color='orange')
# draw the box
ax.add_patch(rect)
# draw the dots
for key, value in result['keypoints'].items():
# create and draw dot
dot = plt.Circle(value, radius=20, color='red')
ax.add_patch(dot)
# show the plot
plt.show()
# filename = 'test1.webp' # filename is defined above, otherwise uncomment
# load image from file
# pixels = plt.imread(filename) # defined above, otherwise uncomment
# detector is defined above, otherwise uncomment
#detector = mtcnn.MTCNN()
# detect faces in the image
faces = detector.detect_faces(pixels)
# display faces on the original image
draw_facebox(filename, faces)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;h2 id="advanced-mtcnn-speed-it-up-x100">Advanced MTCNN: Speed it up (\~x100)!&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Now let us come to the interesting part. If you are going to process millions of pictures you will need to speed up MTCNN, otherwise, you will either fall asleep or your CPU will burn before it will be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what exactly are we talking about? If you are running the above code it will take around one second, meaning we will process around one picture per second. If you are running MTCNN on a GPU and use the sped-up version it will achieve around 60-100 pictures/frames a second. That is a boost of up to &lt;strong>100 times&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are for example going to extract all faces of a movie, where you will extract 10 faces per second (one second of the movie has on average around 24 frames, so every second frame) it will be 10 * 60 (seconds) * 120 (minutes) = 72,000 frames.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meaning if it takes one second to process one frame it will take 72,000 * 1 (seconds) = 72,000s / 60s = 1,200m = &lt;strong>20 hours&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the sped-up version of MTCNN this task will take 72,000 (frames) / 100 (frames/sec) = 720 seconds = &lt;strong>12 minutes&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use MTCNN on a GPU you will need to set up CUDA, cudnn, pytorch and so on. &lt;a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch wrote a good tutorial about that part&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once installed we will do the necessary imports as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>from facenet_pytorch import MTCNN
from PIL import Image
import torch
from imutils.video import FileVideoStream
import cv2
import time
import glob
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
filenames = [&amp;quot;glediston-bastos-ZtmmR9D_2tA-unsplash.webp&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;glediston-bastos-ZtmmR9D_2tA-unsplash.webp&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>See how we defined the device in the code above? You will be able to run everything on a CPU as well if you do not want or can set up CUDA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we will define the extractor:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># define our extractor
fast_mtcnn = FastMTCNN(
stride=4,
resize=0.5,
margin=14,
factor=0.6,
keep_all=True,
device=device
)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In this snippet, we pass along some parameters, where we for example only use half of the image size, which is one of the main impact factors for speeding it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, let us run the face extraction script:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>def run_detection(fast_mtcnn, filenames):
frames = []
frames_processed = 0
faces_detected = 0
batch_size = 60
start = time.time()
for filename in tqdm(filenames):
v_cap = FileVideoStream(filename).start()
v_len = int(v_cap.stream.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))
for j in range(v_len):
frame = v_cap.read()
frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
frames.append(frame)
if len(frames) &amp;gt;= batch_size or j == v_len - 1:
faces = fast_mtcnn(frames)
frames_processed += len(frames)
faces_detected += len(faces)
frames = []
print(
f'Frames per second: {frames_processed / (time.time() - start):.3f},',
f'faces detected: {faces_detected}\r',
end=''
)
v_cap.stop()
run_detection(fast_mtcnn, filenames)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/teslap100frames.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above image shows the output of the code running on an NVIDIA Tesla P100, so depending on the source material, GPU and processor you might experience better or worse performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I divided this post into the “Why did I do it” and the “Technical How To”. If you want to skip the “Why” part, feel free to directly jump to the Technical part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-should-i-deploy-a-machine-learning-model-in-aws-lambda">Why should I deploy a machine learning model in AWS Lambda?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Reliability:&lt;/strong> The algorithm will execute independently of other systems, updates, …&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Performance Efficiency:&lt;/strong> I can run several algorithms on one (small) system, independent from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Cost Savings:&lt;/strong> AWS allows for &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?did=ft_card&amp;amp;trk=ft_card">3,2 million compute-seconds&lt;/a> per month, basically letting me run all my algorithms for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been searching for a way to first make sure my investment bot surely executes because a failed execution might cost a lot of money if a trade is not canceled promptly if it goes in the wrong direction. Additionally, I wanted to avoid letting my computer run all the time and to make sure several algorithms could run next to each other, without influencing or delaying their execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, it is a nice thought to have an investing algorithm run without worrying about operating system updates, hardware failures, and power cuts, etc, which is the general advantage of serverless technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now, I can run several variations of the algorithm to test out alterations of the algorithm and can be sure that it will run. Another nice thing? AWS offers around 1 Million free Lambda calls, which lets me run the whole architecture in its free tier contingent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-investing-algorithm">The investing algorithm&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am going to explain the algorithm in more depth in another post on my website &lt;a href="http://www.datafortress.cloud">www.datafortress.cloud&lt;/a>, but my typical investment algorithm setup consists of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Testing the algorithm using &lt;a href="https://www.backtrader.com/">Backtrader&lt;/a>, an open-source backtesting framework written in python&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Converting the successful algorithm into a single python file containing a run() method that returns which investments have been done&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transferring the python file to AWS Lambda, where I am calling the run() function with AWS Lambda’s lambda_handler function&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In this example algorithm, I take investment decisions depending on if the current price is above or below the trendline predicted by &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Facebook’s prophet model&lt;/a>. I have &lt;a href="http://seangtkelley.me/blog/2018/08/15/algo-trading-pt2">taken ideas from Sean Kelley&lt;/a>, who wrote a Backtrader setup on how to utilize prophet with Backtrader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My stock universe in this setup is calculated by choosing the top 20 stocks out of the SPY500 index, which achieved the highest return in the past X timesteps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data source is Yahoo finance, using the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/">free yfinance library&lt;/a>, and as my algorithmic broker of choice, I have chosen &lt;a href="https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca.markets&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my setup, the algorithm will execute once per day at 3 p.m. or every 15 minutes during trading hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problems-deploying-facebook-prophet-to-aws-lambda">The problems deploying Facebook Prophet to AWS Lambda&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>AWS Lambda comes with some python libraries preinstalled, but as many of you might know, this is by default quite limited (which is reasonable for Lambda’s promise). Still, Lambda allows for private packages to be installed which is quite easy for smaller packages (see the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html">official documentation&lt;/a>) but becomes a little more complicated if dealing with packages that exceed 250 Mb in size. Unfortunately, Facebook’s prophet model exceeds this boundary, but luckily &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-fbprophet-work-on-aws-lambda-c3a33a081aaf">Alexandr Matsenov solved this issue by reducing the package size&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcmetz/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda">Marc Metz handled compilation issues to make it run on AWS Lambda&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Non-default libraries can be added to AWS Lambda by using Layers, which contain all the packages needed. If a layer is imported, you can simply import the packages in your python function as you would do it in your local setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-technical">How to (technical)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, let me explain how exactly you can achieve this. See this TLDR for the impatient types, or the more detailed version below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TLDR;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You will need a Lambda Layer, upload mine (&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/raw/master/python.zip">download&lt;/a>) containing Prophet, yfinance, … to an S3 bucket (private access)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select AWS Lambda, create a function, add a layer and paste in your S3 object URL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paste your lambda_function.py into the Lambda Editor (&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/blob/master/lambda_function.py">or use mine&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up your Environment variables (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Either run it manually by clicking “test” or head over to CloudWatch -&amp;gt; Rules -&amp;gt; Create Rule and set up “Schedule Execution” to run it in a specified time interval&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Detailed Explanation&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-creating-a-custom-layer-for-aws-lambda">1. Creating a custom layer for AWS Lambda&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can either use my Lambda layer containing Facebook Prophet, NumPy, pandas, &lt;a href="https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-python">alpaca-trading-API&lt;/a>, yfinance (&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda">GitHub&lt;/a>) or compile your own using the explanation given by &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@marc.a.metz/docker-run-rm-it-v-pwd-var-task-lambci-lambda-build-python3-7-bash-c7d53f3b7eb2">Marc&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Using my Lambda Layer&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download the zip file from my &lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/raw/master/python.zip">Github repo&lt;/a> containing all packages (&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/raw/master/python.zip">Link&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As you can only directly upload layers to Lambda until the size of 50 Mb, we will first need to upload the file to AWS S3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a bucket and place the downloaded zip file into it. Access can remain private and does NOT need to be public! Copy the URL to your file (e.g. &lt;a href="https://BUCKETNAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/python.zip" title="https://BUCKETNAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/python.zip">https://BUCKETNAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/python.zip&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Log into AWS and go to Lambda -&amp;gt; Layers (&lt;a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-central-1#/layers">EU central Link&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click “Create layer”, give it a matching name and select “Upload a file from Amazon S3”, and copy the code of step 3 into it. As Runtimes select Python 3.7. Click create.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Compiling your own Lambda Layer&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@marc.a.metz/docker-run-rm-it-v-pwd-var-task-lambci-lambda-build-python3-7-bash-c7d53f3b7eb2">follow the instructions of Marc&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-setting-up-an-aws-lambda-function">2. Setting up an AWS Lambda function&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Open the Lambda Function Dashboard (&lt;a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-central-1#/functions">EU central Link&lt;/a>) and click “Create function”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave the “Author from scratch” checkbox as is and give it a fitting name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In “Runtime”, select Python 3.7, leave the rest as is and click “Create function”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the overview of the “designer” tab, you will see a graphical representation of your Lambda function. Click on the “layers” box below it and click “Add a layer”. If you correctly set up the layer, you will be able to select it in the following dialogue. Finally, click on “Add”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the “designer” tab, select your Lambda Function. If you scroll down, you will see a default python code snippet in a file called “lambda_function.py”. If you have structured your code the same as mine (&lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/blob/master/lambda_function.py">Link&lt;/a>), you can execute your function with the run() function. If a Lambda function is called, it will execute the lambda_handler(event, context) function from which you could e.g. call the run() function. Of course, you can rename all files and functions, but for the simplicity of this project, I left it as it is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel free to just paste in &lt;a href="https://github.com/JustinGuese/How-To-Deploy-Facebook-Prophet-on-AWS-Lambda/blob/master/lambda_function.py">my function&lt;/a> and test it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clicking on “Test” should result in successful execution, otherwise, it will state the errors in the dialogue.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="3-using-environment-variables-in-aws-lambda">3. Using environment variables in AWS Lambda&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You should never leave your user and password as cleartext in your code, which is why you should always use environment variables! Luckily, Lambda uses them as well, and they can easily be called with the python os package. E.g. in my script I am calling the user variable with os.environ[&amp;lsquo;ALPACAUSER&amp;rsquo;]. The environment variables can be set up in the main Lambda function screen when scrolling down below your code editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-trigger-aws-lambda-functions-at-a-specified-time-interval">4. Trigger AWS Lambda functions at a specified time interval&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The concept of serverless and AWS Lambda is built on the idea that a function is executed when a trigger event happens. In my setup, I wanted the function to be called e.g. every 15 minutes during trading hours, Monday to Friday. Luckily, AWS offers a way to trigger an event without the need to run a server, using the CloudWatch service.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Head over to CloudWatch (&lt;a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-central-1">EU central Link&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the left panel, select “Events” and “Rules”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on “Create Rule”, and select “Schedule” instead of “Event pattern”. Here you can use the simple “Fixed-rate” dialogue, or create a cron expression. I am using &lt;a href="https://crontab.guru/" title="https://crontab.guru/">https://crontab.guru/&lt;/a> (free) to create cron expressions. My cron expression for the abovementioned use case is “0/15 13-21 ? * MON-FRI *”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the right panel, select “Add Target” and select your Lambda function. It will automatically be added to Lambda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally click on “Configure details”, give it a name, and click on “Create rule”.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="5-optional-log-analysis-error-search">5. (optional) Log Analysis, Error Search&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you have made it to this part, you should be done! But if you want to check if everything worked, you can use CloudWatch to have a look at the outputs of the Lambda functions. Head over to CloudWatch -&amp;gt; Logs -&amp;gt; Log groups (&lt;a href="https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-central-1#logsV2:log-groups">EU central Link&lt;/a>) and select your Lambda function. In this overview, you should be able to see the output of your functions.&lt;/p>

This article provides a comprehensive guide for navigating German data protection laws, including an overview of key regulations and step-by-step strategies for compliance. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a small business owner or a compliance officer, this guide will help you understand the importance of data privacy and protect your organization from potential legal and financial risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demystifying-german-data-protection-laws">Demystifying German Data Protection Laws&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Germany has some of the most stringent data protection laws in the world, with a strong emphasis on individual privacy rights. These laws are important for businesses operating in Germany as they provide a framework for ensuring the privacy and security of personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent changes, such as the implementation of the EU GDPR, have further strengthened the data protection regime in Germany, with new requirements for businesses around data processing, consent, and breach reporting. Non-compliance with these laws can result in significant fines and damage to a company&amp;rsquo;s reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To navigate German data protection laws, businesses should first become familiar with the key legislation, including the Federal Data Protection Act and GDPR. They should also conduct a thorough assessment of their data processing activities, identifying any areas of risk and developing appropriate policies and procedures to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other important steps for compliance include appointing a data protection officer (DPO), implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, and conducting regular training and awareness programs for staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, compliance with German data protection laws requires a continuous effort to stay up-to-date with changes in the legal landscape and to maintain a culture of privacy and data protection within the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-step-by-step-guide-to-navigating-german-data-protection-laws-for-enterprises">A Step-by-Step Guide to Navigating German Data Protection Laws for Enterprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this segment, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how enterprises can navigate the German data protection laws to ensure compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understand the applicable laws: The first step is to have a comprehensive understanding of the German data protection laws, including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Enterprises should also be aware of any industry-specific regulations that may apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conduct a data audit: The next step is to conduct a data audit to identify the types of personal data that the enterprise processes and the purposes for which the data is used. This audit will help the enterprise to identify areas of risk and ensure that all data processing activities are compliant with the applicable laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures: Enterprises must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data. This includes access controls, encryption, and regular data backups, as well as ongoing staff training on data protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO): Under the GDPR, some enterprises are required to appoint a DPO who will be responsible for overseeing data protection activities. Even if a DPO is not required, it can be beneficial to appoint one to ensure that data protection measures are properly implemented and maintained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Document compliance efforts: It is essential to document compliance efforts, including policies, procedures, and staff training, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable data protection laws.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="battle-of-the-containerization-tools-kubernetes-vs-docker-compose-vs-vm-hosting">Battle of the Containerization Tools: Kubernetes vs Docker Compose vs VM Hosting&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="docker-the-lightweight-portable-option-for-hosting-applications">Docker: The Lightweight, Portable Option for Hosting Applications&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Docker: Leightweight, proof-of-concept, running multiple programs on one server&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Docker has become a popular tool for application development and deployment in recent years. Its popularity can be attributed to its lightweight, portable nature, making it an excellent choice for hosting applications. Unlike traditional virtual machines, Docker containers do not require a complete operating system to be installed, resulting in a much smaller footprint. This feature also enables the use of the same container across different environments, making it easy to move from development to production. Additionally, Docker containers are easily scalable, allowing you to add or remove resources as needed. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a cost-effective and efficient way to host your applications, Docker might be the perfect solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a containerization technology that enables developers to create, package, and distribute applications in an isolated and portable environment. In simpler terms, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of bundling an application with all its dependencies into a single package, making it easy to move between different environments or host on multiple servers. For CEOs, this means that Docker can simplify the deployment of new applications, reduce infrastructure costs, and increase the reliability and security of their software. By using Docker, you can easily create and manage containers, ensuring that your applications run consistently and reliably across any infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to traditional hosting in Virtual Machines (VMs), Docker offers several advantages. One of the most significant is its lightweight and portable nature. Docker containers are much smaller in size than VMs and require fewer resources to run. This makes them faster to deploy, more efficient to manage, and easier to scale up or down as needed. Docker also provides an isolated and standardized environment for applications, ensuring that they run the same way across different servers. However, there are also potential downsides to using Docker, such as the need for additional expertise to manage containers and potential security concerns if not configured properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But isn&amp;rsquo;t Kubernetes the same as Docker? How do they differ?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kubernetes-the-scalable-solution-for-large-scale-container-management">Kubernetes: The Scalable Solution for Large-Scale Container Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kubernetes: Docker, but running on multiple machines. Self-repair, Security, Automation, Enterprise&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Kubernetes is a popular open-source platform for automating container deployment, scaling, and management. It is designed to manage large-scale containerized applications, providing a highly scalable, portable, and extensible platform. Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container orchestration, allowing organizations to manage their containers across multiple hosts, automate deployment, and ensure availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The platform works by abstracting the underlying infrastructure and providing a container-centric approach to application management. This makes it easier for developers to deploy and manage their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Kubernetes provides a highly resilient and self-healing system, allowing for automatic failover and reducing the risk of downtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kubernetes has a number of advantages over traditional hosting solutions. Firstly, it is highly scalable, allowing organizations to deploy and manage a large number of containers across multiple hosts. This enables organizations to quickly and easily scale their applications as needed. Additionally, Kubernetes is highly portable, enabling organizations to move their applications between cloud providers and on-premises data centers without having to make significant changes to the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Kubernetes can be more complex to set up and manage compared to traditional hosting solutions. It requires a more significant investment of time and resources to set up and manage the platform, and it may not be suitable for smaller applications or organizations with limited resources. Additionally, Kubernetes has a steeper learning curve for developers, who need to become proficient in the platform&amp;rsquo;s architecture and APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, Kubernetes is an excellent solution for organizations that need to manage large-scale containerized applications. It provides a highly scalable, portable, and extensible platform that can be used to manage containers across multiple hosts. However, organizations should carefully consider their needs and resources before deciding to adopt the platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vms-the-traditional-hosting-solution-still-holding-strong">VMs: The Traditional Hosting Solution Still Holding Strong&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>VMs: Low knowledge required, high resource usage, instable&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Virtual machines, or VMs, have been the backbone of hosting applications for years, and continue to be a reliable and trusted option for businesses. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the pros and cons of using VMs as a hosting solution, and compare them to newer options like Docker and Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main advantages of using VMs is their stability and security. Each VM operates in its own isolated environment, so any issues or breaches on one VM won&amp;rsquo;t affect the others. VMs are also highly customizable, allowing businesses to create and configure VMs to meet their specific needs. However, VMs can be resource-intensive, requiring a dedicated server to run, and can be slow to scale up or down in response to changing demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to newer options like Docker and Kubernetes, VMs may seem outdated, but they still have their place. VMs are ideal for running legacy applications that may not be compatible with newer container-based solutions, and they are often more affordable than other hosting options. However, the lack of scalability and agility of VMs may be a disadvantage for businesses that require rapid deployment and frequent updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, VMs remain a solid choice for businesses that need a reliable, secure hosting solution for legacy applications or other specific use cases. However, for those looking for a more agile and scalable solution, newer options like Docker and Kubernetes may be a better fit. It&amp;rsquo;s important to evaluate your business&amp;rsquo;s specific needs and requirements before choosing a hosting solution, and to weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-docker-kubernetes-and-vms-for-application-hosting">Pros and Cons of Docker, Kubernetes, and VMs for Application Hosting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Summarizing our above findings, we can say that Docker is a lightweight, portable solution that allows for application deployment in a consistent manner across different environments. One of the key advantages of Docker is its ability to isolate and containerize applications, which allows for increased security and flexibility. Additionally, because Docker containers are so lightweight, they can be deployed quickly, making it a great solution for small to medium-scale applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, Kubernetes is designed for large-scale container management and is a scalable solution that can be used to orchestrate containerized applications across a large number of nodes. Kubernetes is a great solution for organizations that need to manage a large number of containers across multiple environments. Its key features include load balancing, automatic scaling, and self-healing capabilities, making it a great solution for mission-critical applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, traditional VMs offer a reliable and stable solution for hosting applications. VMs have been around for a long time and are well-understood by IT professionals, making them a safe choice for mission-critical applications. While VMs may not be as flexible as Docker or Kubernetes, they can still offer good performance and scalability, making them a great option for organizations that have already invested in the technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the choice between Docker, Kubernetes, and traditional VMs will depend on your specific needs and requirements. While Docker is a great choice for smaller applications, Kubernetes is designed for larger, more complex environments, and traditional VMs are a reliable and stable option for mission-critical applications. It&amp;rsquo;s important to weigh the pros and cons of each solution carefully and consult with experts if necessary to ensure you make the right choice for your organization.&lt;/p>

These would be calculations like &amp;ldquo;if the price is above 100 USD, and the volume above 2000, the price will most likely go up&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Newcomers to Machine Learning are now trying to solve this problem by training for decades, or using more and more GPUs, but a way more efficient way would be to feed that algorithm with additional data, such that it can use more resources to infer it&amp;rsquo;s calculations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be achieved by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Getting more data (a bigger timespan)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding statistical metrics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding your own signals and interpretations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="hands-on-enhancing-your-data">Hands-on: Enhancing your data&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="first-steps---getting-your-data">First steps - Getting your data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, let us grab some basic OHLCV data. I like the yfinance (&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" title="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/">https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/&lt;/a>) module for its simplicity. It is not comparable to live-streams of data, but on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s free and great for experimentation!&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib ta
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Import that module as well as Pandas Numpy Matplotlib&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Get some stock data, interval and period refer to the timeranges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>interval accepts values like 1m,2m,5m,15m,30m,60m,90m,1h,1d,5d,1wk,1mo,3mo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>period accepts values like 1d,5d,1mo,3mo,6mo,1y,2y,5y,10y,ytd,max&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not all combinations work, like 1m (1 Minute) intervals are only working with 7d max, 1h (1 hour) with 3 months max (needs to be written as 90d). But let&amp;rsquo;s work with daily data first&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>df = yf.download(&amp;quot;MSFT&amp;quot;,period=&amp;quot;5y&amp;quot;,interval=&amp;quot;1d&amp;quot;)
df.head()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/screenshot-from-2021-01-27-14-46-45.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quick excourse: What the heck is Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume? Where is the price?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no &amp;ldquo;one price&amp;rdquo; in the stock market! You can imagine OHLCV data as &amp;ldquo;buckets&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bins&amp;rdquo; in time, summarizing all the trades that occurred in that window. The typical &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; chart you know usually refers to the &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo; price of that stock in time range X, e.g. the value the stock had at the close of the time range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we are looking at daily data, &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; refers to the average (!) stock price at open of the markets, whilst &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo; refers to the average (!) price the stock had at the close of markets. If looking at hourly data, the &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; refers to the beginning of that hour, like 11 am, and the &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo; to the close of that hour, so 11:59:59 am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equally &amp;ldquo;High&amp;rdquo; is the highest trade/price recorded in that time frame, and &amp;ldquo;Low&amp;rdquo; the lowest one. Volume refers to the number of assets or stocks traded in that time range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meaning if e.g. &amp;ldquo;Low&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo; of a column are close to each other, we are most likely seeing a downwards trend as the close is the current low. Also if Volume is high, there is a lot of trades going on, so if e.g. the Volume is higher than usual there seems to be something going on in the market. But anyway, head over to &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/" title="https://www.investopedia.com/">https://www.investopedia.com/&lt;/a> for that, we will continue coding now!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-adj-close">What is &amp;ldquo;Adj Close&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is important, as most ML algorithms are terribly confused by &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; close-data. If there is a split in the stock, the data will look like the price has an insane drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason is, simply said, that if a stock get&amp;rsquo;s too expensive, the company decides to &amp;ldquo;split&amp;rdquo; the stock in two. Does that mean my investment halves? Of course not, you will simply get double the stocks you are holding, so on paper you still hold the same value of that stock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly a split usually causes prices to rise (silly humans!), and if your machine learning algorithm sees a huge drop in price it will most likely sell the hell out of that stock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this reason, you should always use &amp;ldquo;adjusted&amp;rdquo; values, which can be imagined as &amp;ldquo;cleaned&amp;rdquo; price data, keeping in mind the splits, dividends, and all other events not affecting the true value of data. Therefore try to always use adjusted data for your algorithms!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of yfinance it is easy to do, as we can just use &amp;ldquo;Adj Close&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plotting-the-data">Plotting the data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Looking at the data we can already see a nice, well-known curve&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>plt.plot(df[&amp;quot;Adj Close&amp;quot;])
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="step-two-enhancing-your-data-with-statistical-data">Step two: Enhancing your data with statistical data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As said above, we need to create more information from our data for the algorithm to use, as it can not do this on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to use the library ta (&lt;a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" title="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta">https://github.com/bukosabino/ta&lt;/a>) as again, it is super easy to use and contains 100+ statistical calculations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install and import it with&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>pip install ta
from ta import add_all_ta_features
from ta.utils import dropna
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now if you already know which values you want to use you can only pick these, oooor we just smash all 100+ at our data:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>df = dropna(df) # clean nans if present
df = add_all_ta_features(df,open=&amp;quot;Open&amp;quot;, high=&amp;quot;High&amp;quot;, low=&amp;quot;Low&amp;quot;, close=&amp;quot;Adj Close&amp;quot;, volume=&amp;quot;Volume&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So what have we done?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>df.columns
Index(['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', 'Volume', 'volume_adi',

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Well, that should be enough for now!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, there is still a lot of nans in there, as some values are only calculated if enough time passed. In my experience filling them with zeros works quite well, even though there are more advanced techniques for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>df = df.fillna(0)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="step-three-creating-your-own-signals">Step three: Creating your own signals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now it is time to translate your weird trade ideas into numbers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us start with the classic Moving Average cross. The idea is as follows: If a short moving average crosses a slower moving average, it either indicates a price rise or fall, depending on the direction of the cross.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, have a look at investopedia for details: &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp" title="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/052014/how-use-moving-average-buy-stocks.asp&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal is to first calculate the SMA&amp;rsquo;s, and then to formulate crosses as 1 and -1, and 0 to signal no cross.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-simple-moving-averages">Creating Simple Moving Averages&lt;/h3>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># creating simple moving averages
averages = [1,2,5,10,15,20,25,50,100]
for average in averages:
df['SMA_%d'%average] = df[&amp;quot;Adj Close&amp;quot;].rolling(window=average).mean()
# visualize only SMAs
filter_col = [col for col in df if col.startswith('SMA')]
df[filter_col].tail()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And some visualization:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code># results in bigger figures
plt.rcParams[&amp;quot;figure.figsize&amp;quot;] = (20,20)
for filter in filter_col:
plt.plot(df[filter],label=filter)
plt.legend()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/download.png" alt="SMA python trading" title="Image by author">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-a-crossover-signal">Creating a crossover signal&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let us use a little helper function&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>def createCross(data,fastSMA,slowSMA):
fast = 'SMA_%d'%fastSMA
slow = 'SMA_%d'%slowSMA
crossname = &amp;quot;cross_%d_%d&amp;quot;%(fastSMA,slowSMA)
previous_fast = data[fast].shift(1)
previous_slow = data[slow].shift(1)
neg = ((data[fast] &amp;lt; data[slow]) &amp;amp; (previous_fast &amp;gt;= previous_slow))
pos = ((data[fast] &amp;gt; data[slow]) &amp;amp; (previous_fast &amp;lt;= previous_slow))
data[crossname] = 0
data.loc[neg,crossname] = -1
data.loc[pos,crossname] = 1
return data
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And now you could either insert custom values or follow our example and just take the cross products:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>for fast in averages:
for slow in averages:
if fast != slow and slow &amp;gt; fast:
df = createCross(df,fast,slow)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This created a perfect classification signal signaling an upwards cross with 1, and a downwards cross with -1, with 0 being a neutral (no-cross).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is just one example of what further signals you can provide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-a-percentage-change-column">Creating a percentage change column&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>And to add another example, if you are trying to predict the percentage change you will need a column showing the percentage change to the previous time range. This can luckily be easily done using pandas.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>df[&amp;quot;pct_change&amp;quot;] = df[&amp;quot;Adj Close&amp;quot;].pct_change()

&lt;p>What a perfect signal for a regressional model!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before we added our enhancements the dataframe just contained 5 columns, not much for a machine learning model!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, after adding statistical values and our own signals, we already reached 135 features and columns of our dataframe!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much better for your model!&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="from-development-to-deployment-hosting-machine-learning-models-with-fastapi-in-kubernetes">From Development to Deployment Hosting Machine Learning Models with FastAPI in Kubernetes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In this article, we will explore how FastAPI and Kubernetes can be used together to host machine learning models from development to deployment. From building machine learning models using FastAPI to deploying them in a scalable and efficient manner in Kubernetes, this article will provide insights on how to optimize the machine learning pipeline. Read on to learn more about how these technologies can help streamline your machine learning workflows and maximize your ROI.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developing-machine-learning-models-with-fastapi-best-practices">Developing Machine Learning Models with FastAPI: Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When it comes to developing machine learning models, FastAPI is a powerful tool that can make the process faster and more efficient. However, there are certain best practices to keep in mind to ensure that your models are accurate, reliable, and easy to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it&amp;rsquo;s important to start with a clear understanding of the problem you&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve and the data you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with. This will help you choose the right algorithms and create a robust pipeline for data processing and model training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to create a modular and reusable code structure that can be easily adapted and scaled for new projects. FastAPI&amp;rsquo;s modular design makes this process straightforward and can save a lot of time and effort in the long run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the accuracy and reliability of your models, it&amp;rsquo;s also essential to follow good testing practices. This means testing your code regularly and using tools like unit testing and integration testing to catch errors and ensure that everything is working as intended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s important to document your code and provide clear and concise documentation for any APIs or models you create. This will make it easier for other team members to understand and work with your code, and can also help users of your models to get the most out of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By following these best practices for developing machine learning models with FastAPI, you can create accurate, reliable, and user-friendly models that can make a real impact in your organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deploying-machine-learning-models-in-kubernetes-a-comprehensive-guide">Deploying Machine Learning Models in Kubernetes: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The key steps involved in deploying machine learning models in Kubernetes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Containerize your ML model: The first step is to package your machine learning model into a container, such as a Docker image, that can be run in Kubernetes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Kubernetes cluster: Set up a Kubernetes cluster, either locally or in the cloud, and ensure that it is configured correctly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Kubernetes deployment: Create a deployment specification for your ML model, which specifies the container image to use, the number of replicas to run, and other details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Kubernetes service: Create a Kubernetes service to expose your ML model as a REST API, which can be accessed by other applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up ingress: If you want to expose your ML model to the internet, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set up ingress to allow incoming traffic to the service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor and manage your deployment: Use Kubernetes tools to monitor and manage your ML model deployment, including scaling, rolling updates, and other operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By following these steps, you can efficiently deploy your machine learning models in Kubernetes and make them available as REST APIs that can be used by other applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-hosting-machine-learning-models-with-fastapi-in-kubernetes">Benefits of Hosting Machine Learning Models with FastAPI in Kubernetes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As machine learning models become more complex, the need for scalable and reliable hosting solutions is on the rise. FastAPI in Kubernetes is a popular combination that provides a flexible, fast, and efficient framework for deploying machine learning models as REST APIs. In this segment, we will explore the benefits of hosting machine learning models with FastAPI in Kubernetes and how it can help enterprises streamline their ML workflows and achieve faster time-to-market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scalability: Kubernetes is designed to scale containerized applications automatically based on demand. This feature makes it an ideal platform for hosting machine learning models that require high computational resources. FastAPI, on the other hand, is a lightweight web framework that provides fast and reliable REST APIs. The combination of these two technologies makes it possible to scale machine learning models up or down seamlessly to handle varying workloads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Portability: Kubernetes provides an easy way to deploy and manage containerized applications across multiple platforms, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. This portability ensures that machine learning models hosted on Kubernetes can be deployed in any environment, making it easy to switch between different cloud providers or on-premises infrastructures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reliability: Kubernetes has built-in features that ensure high availability and reliability of containerized applications, including machine learning models. These features include self-healing, auto-scaling, and rolling updates, which minimize downtime and ensure that applications remain up and running at all times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security: Kubernetes provides several security features, such as network policies, pod security policies, and service accounts, which can help protect machine learning models from unauthorized access or cyber threats. FastAPI, on the other hand, provides security features such as authentication and authorization, which help ensure that only authorized users have access to the REST API endpoints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, hosting machine learning models with FastAPI in Kubernetes provides several benefits, including scalability, portability, reliability, and security. By leveraging these technologies, enterprises can achieve faster time-to-market and streamline their ML workflows, allowing them to focus on delivering more value to their customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="streamlining-the-machine-learning-pipeline-with-fastapi-and-kubernetes">Streamlining the Machine Learning Pipeline with FastAPI and Kubernetes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Machine learning development and deployment can be a complex and time-consuming process, but using the right tools and frameworks can significantly streamline this pipeline. FastAPI in Kubernetes is a winning combination for machine learning pipelines, offering several benefits. To fully realize the benefits of this framework, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to follow some best practices when implementing it in your enterprise. These include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using a version control system: Keep track of changes to your machine learning models by using a version control system like Git. This makes it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary and enables collaboration between team members.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating reproducible builds: Use containerization to create reproducible builds of your machine learning models. This ensures that your applications run consistently across different environments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automating deployment: Use Kubernetes to automate the deployment of your machine learning models as REST APIs. This includes setting up load balancing, managing networking, and scaling your applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitoring and logging: Monitor the performance of your machine learning applications and log key events to facilitate debugging and optimization. Use Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; built-in monitoring and logging tools or integrate with external services.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By following these best practices, you can leverage the benefits of FastAPI in Kubernetes to create a fast, efficient, and scalable machine learning pipeline that can handle a high volume of requests and ensure reliable and available applications.

&lt;p>If Anaconda (conda) and Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter Lab) are set up the right way the combination of them can become the perfect team, where you are able to easily switch between Deep Learning conda environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some programs requiring Tensorflow 1.15, others Tensorflow 2.0? No problem! Just switch environments and Tensorflow versions with a simple click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, did you ever install Jupyter Notebook extensions in each conda environment? Do not worry anymore, we are going to install the extensions once, and have them available in each environment!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-are-we-going-to-achieve-that">How are we going to achieve that?&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install Anaconda or Miniconda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install Jupyter Notebook / Lab in the base environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install a new environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Activate the environment for Jupyter Notebook&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="how-to-install-anaconda-or-miniconda">How to install Anaconda or Miniconda?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Anaconda is a nice package containing a lot of Python packages already and allows for an easy start into the world of Python. Additionally, it allows creating environments in python, which contain different versions of your Python packages. E.g. if a program only runs with Python 2.7 or older versions of Matplotlib, you can create an own workspace for this program and switch back to Python 3 with a click of a button. Furthermore switching between Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow 1.15 becomes easy as well, finally allowing you to switch between versions easily (which can be quite a headache otherwise).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miniconda is a barebones version of Anaconda and can be nice if you are e.g. working on a server, where disk space is limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install Anaconda or Miniconda head over to their website (&lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads" title="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads">https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads&lt;/a>), or if you are using Linux just copy the following commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first link crawls the website for the newest version and writes it to the LATEST_ANACONDA variable.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cd ~/Downloads
LATEST_ANACONDA=$(wget -O - https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | sed -ne 's@.*\(https:\/\/repo\.anaconda\.com\/archive\/Anaconda3-.*-Linux-x86_64\.sh\)\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;64-Bit (x86) Installer.*@\1@p')
wget $LATEST_ANACONDA
chmod +x Anaconda3*.sh # make it executable
./Anaconda3*.sh # execute the installer
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Follow the dialogue, and just agree on the defaults.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="checking-and-switching-the-conda-environments">Checking and switching the conda environments&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If conda is installed correctly (might need a logout and login, or restart), you should be able to see the output when typing &lt;code>conda&lt;/code> into your terminal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To list the currently installed environments just type &lt;code>conda env list&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should currently just show the &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; environment installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Switching between environments works as simply as typing &lt;code>conda activate [NAME]&lt;/code> and if done with it deactivating it (and going back to the base environment) with &lt;code>conda deactivate&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The base environment is activated by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="install-jupyter-notebook--lab-in-the-base-environment">Install Jupyter Notebook / Lab in the base environment&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Jupyter Notebook can easily be installed using conda. Our plan is to only install it in the base environment, and then just switch between sub-environments to avoid setting up Jupyter Lab in each environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-jupyter-notebook-default">Installing Jupyter Notebook (default)&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I really like Jupyter Notebook extensions, which support a lot of autocompletion, additional information, and in general things that make your life easier. A good default setting is included with the following install command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>A good overview over other extensions: &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231" title="https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231">https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="optional-installing-pip-package-manager">(Optional) Installing pip package manager&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my opinion it is a good idea to add the pip package manager to the base (and each sub-) environment, as not all packages are supported by conda install. Also, if pip is not installed in each sub-environment the package might just be installed in the &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; conda environment, causing an error where the package is not found in your sub-environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda install pip
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="creating-environments-in-conda-and-jupyter-notebook">Creating environments in conda and Jupyter Notebook&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let us say you want to install both Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow 1.15 in Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this example first, agree if you want to use the GPU or CPU version of Tensorflow. For using the GPU version add &amp;ldquo;-gpu&amp;rdquo; to TensorFlow, and otherwise, just leave it as is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create a new conda environment we can run&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>conda create --name tf-2.0&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you already plan to install some packages with it just add them to the end, like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda create -n tf-2.0 tensorflow-gpu pip ipykernel
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I recommend installing &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> for package installation, and &lt;code>ipykernel&lt;/code> will be needed to switch environments using Jupyter Notebook&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install an environment using TensorFlow 1.15 use the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda create -n tf-1.15 tensorflow-gpu==1.15 pip ipykernel
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If done successfully, you should be able to see three environments when executing the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda env list
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tf-2.0&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tf-1.15&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="start-jupyter-notebook-and-check-the-environments-and-extensions">Start Jupyter Notebook and check the environments and extensions&lt;/h1>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>jupyter notebook
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Running Jupyter Notebook in the base environment should allow you to see a tab containing &amp;ldquo;Extensions&amp;rdquo;, as well as &amp;ldquo;conda&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;environments&amp;rdquo;. Head over to Extensions and activate whichever extensions you like, and if you are ready, create a new notebook using the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; button. Here, you should be able to choose between your base, tf-2.0 and tf-1.15 environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attention: You always need to run jupyter notebook in the base environment. Run &lt;code>conda deactivate&lt;/code> to leave your current environment and return to the base one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to install further packages activate an environment using &lt;code>conda activate [NAME]&lt;/code>, run your commands like &lt;code>conda install X&lt;/code> or &lt;code>pip install X&lt;/code>, and leave the environment using &lt;code>conda deactivate&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this worked for you, it helped me a lot and I wished I would have known about this earlier!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The 5 typical applications of Augmented Reality</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/blog/the-5-typical-applications-of-augmented-reality/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Justin Güse</author><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/blog/the-5-typical-applications-of-augmented-reality/</guid><description>

&lt;p>2018 has truly been the year of Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality first came into the public eye through games like &amp;ldquo;Pokemon Go&amp;rdquo; and co, but the basic technology has been around for ages - the first capable &amp;ldquo;Heads-Up Displays&amp;rdquo; were developed in the 1980s (&lt;a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/11/02/eye-am-a-camera-surveillance-and-sousveillance-in-the-glassage/">Link&lt;/a>), but why is an augmented reality only now making a breakthrough and what is AR anyway? Find out on this page!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Augmented Reality, or augmented reality, is the term used to describe the enrichment of our perceived sensory impressions with artificially created additional information. The classical definition of AR limits the additional information to the fact that it has to be transmitted virtually via a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-11-17/ar-vr-is-fourth-wave-of-technology-digi-capital-founder">link &lt;/a>and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/12.197321">link&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Augmented Reality applications for the military, or for general visualizations, have been around since the early years, but the reason why the breakthrough only happened now is that at that time a PC set, as well as the screens, were much too bulky to be affordable for the masses, and secondly, they were reasonably portable. Nowadays, fortunately, everyone has a portable computer in their pocket - the smartphone. As smartphones become more widespread, augmented reality is becoming more accessible, and anyone can use AR at no great technical cost. In the end, this was the trigger for Augmented Reality to make its breakthrough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, several large companies predict that the AR and VR market will exceed the 108 billion US dollar mark in 2021 (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/the-reality-of-vrar-growth/">Link&lt;/a>) and thus be one of the fastest-growing markets in human history.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-augmented-reality-work">How does Augmented Reality work?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Roughly speaking, for the end-user, AR is nothing more than an app on the smartphone. There will always be a trigger, or &amp;ldquo;trigger&amp;rdquo;, that triggers content in the app, which is then projected onto the screen of the device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A trigger in this case does not have to be a QR Code, as many mistakenly think, but can be anything from a picture to a 3D object. The art of the algorithm in the background is to determine the position and size of the trigger and to project the content optically correct onto it. What the content is, is almost irrelevant. You can play a video over an image, or an animated 3D object over an image - the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-5-typical-applications-of-augmented-reality">The 5 typical applications of Augmented Reality&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Of course, as with virtual reality, the use cases are countless, but I have tried to break it down to the five most typical areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-ar-marketing-and-advertising">1. AR marketing and advertising&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The greatest potential for Augmented Reality is certainly advertising. Print advertising is often ignored because there has simply been a flood of information in recent years and no print advertising can really achieve its targeted effect. This will change with AR because with AR a &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; print advertisement can be brought to life. Imagine for example your standard print ad of a car at a bus stop and compare the effect on customers between the standard print and an animation of how the car &amp;ldquo;drives through the window&amp;rdquo; and can be walked on interactively - the AR experience will definitely be more memorable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-information-enrichment-through-augmented-reality">2. Information enrichment through augmented reality&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The augmented reality will be perfectly suited to enrich our previous perception with further information. The best-known example, in this case, is AR-glasses like the &amp;ldquo;Google Glasses&amp;rdquo;. Here you see the world &amp;ldquo;as usual&amp;rdquo;, but you can always fade in more information to give more information. For example, imagine that every person you see would have their name above them, or you would never have to ask &amp;ldquo;What kind of car is this?&amp;rdquo; because their AR-Glasses would have shown you this information long ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-remote-assistancetraining-with-augmented-reality">3. remote assistance/training with augmented reality&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Augmented Reality will also revolutionize training because in the future there will be &amp;ldquo;support centers&amp;rdquo; to support an armada of technicians or support staff. Take the example of a repairman for a machine manufacturer. No mechanic knows every machine, and it often takes weeks and a lot of time to fly in a special technician and have the machine repaired. With augmented reality (AR), a low-level mechanic can now be assisted over distance by the specialized mechanic and perform operations that would previously have taken weeks and millions. In practical terms, this could mean, for example, that the specialized mechanic can put information into the AR glasses of the local worker and &amp;ldquo;see what he sees&amp;rdquo;, and act as if he were on site, only for half a million Euros less.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-ar-in-gaming-and-entertainment">4. AR in gaming and entertainment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Like virtual reality, augmented reality has also been massively driven by the games industry. Even though AR is not as immersive as VR (see VR page), it is more accessible because you don&amp;rsquo;t need VR glasses or a high-performance PC. It is also a new format and very accessible for people who have no previous gaming experience because the game principle is comparable to familiar interactions. This was one of the reasons why &amp;ldquo;Pokemon Go&amp;rdquo; prescribed 600 million US dollars in sales in the first three months after its launch alone (&lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/10/20/pokemon-go-is-the-fastest-mobile-game-to-hit-600-million-in-revenues/">Link&lt;/a>). How much revenue did you generate with your app?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="5-education-revolutionized-by-augmented-reality">5. education revolutionized by augmented reality&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Although this is actually one of the previous points I have highlighted it because AR will have such a massive impact on our education system that it is worth a point of its own. The current educational system is far behind - I assure you that no student or pupil will remember more than 30 percent of the content two weeks after the exam. Imagine you have to memorize all the nerve tracts of the body. If you could now aim AR at your own arm and get the names of the nerve tracts on your own body animated, you would certainly remember this much better than if you read it in a book. The reason is that AR can address many more senses and is much more interactive than learning with a book (&lt;a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1881/0b28c827511c3d1695de59078c3ee8eaaa37.pdf">Link&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="and-how-can-ar-improve-your-business">And how can AR improve your business?&lt;/h2>

&lt;h1 id="german-data-protection-laws-for-businesses-everything-you-need-to-know">German Data Protection Laws for Businesses Everything You Need to Know&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a business operating in Germany, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand and comply with the country&amp;rsquo;s data protection laws. But with constantly changing regulations, it can be a daunting task. In this comprehensive guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover everything you need to know about German data protection laws, including recent changes, potential consequences of non-compliance, and tips for staying compliant. Stay ahead of the game and protect personal data with this ultimate guide to German data protection laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ultimate-guide-to-german-data-protection-laws-what-businesses-need-to-know">The Ultimate Guide to German Data Protection Laws: What Businesses Need to Know&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In recent years, data protection has become an increasingly important issue for businesses operating in Germany. The country has some of the strictest data protection laws in the world, with a legal framework that places a high priority on protecting the privacy of individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set out the legal requirements for how businesses must collect, use, and store personal data. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in severe penalties, including fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2018, the GDPR was implemented in Germany, which further strengthened the country&amp;rsquo;s data protection laws. The GDPR aims to provide a uniform data protection law across the EU and harmonize the rules regarding the processing of personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compliance with German data protection laws is essential for businesses operating in the country, not only to avoid the risk of penalties but also to build trust with customers and protect their reputation. By prioritizing data protection and implementing appropriate measures, businesses can enhance their data security and demonstrate their commitment to protecting personal information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="navigating-german-data-protection-laws-a-comprehensive-overview-for-businesses">Navigating German Data Protection Laws: A Comprehensive Overview for Businesses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>German data protection laws are some of the strictest in the world, and businesses operating in Germany must comply with a range of regulations to avoid hefty fines and reputational damage. In this segment, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide a comprehensive overview of German data protection laws, including recent changes and the implications for businesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overview of German Data Protection Laws:
The German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG) sets out the legal framework for data protection in Germany, and there are also specific laws and regulations for certain sectors, such as healthcare and telecommunications. In addition, Germany has implemented the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets out stricter requirements for data protection across the EU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implications for Businesses:
Businesses operating in Germany must comply with the BDSG and GDPR, which require them to obtain explicit consent for data collection, ensure that data is collected and processed lawfully, and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Navigating German Data Protection Laws:
To navigate German data protection laws, businesses must understand their obligations and implement appropriate policies and procedures. This includes conducting a thorough risk assessment, appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO), implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, and providing regular staff training on data protection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="staying-compliant-understanding-german-data-protection-laws-for-businesses">Staying Compliant: Understanding German Data Protection Laws for Businesses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data protection laws are critical for businesses operating in Germany. With the growing concern of data privacy, it is imperative to understand and comply with the regulations. In this segment, we will delve into the importance of staying compliant with German data protection laws and discuss the key requirements that businesses must follow to avoid penalties and reputational damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is Compliance Important?
Complying with German data protection laws is essential for businesses, as failure to do so can result in hefty fines and a damaged reputation. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented in Germany mandates that businesses take appropriate measures to protect personal data, including the collection, processing, and storage of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key Requirements:
German data protection laws require businesses to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting their personal data. Additionally, companies must implement measures to ensure that personal data is only processed for the intended purpose and that it is protected from unauthorized access, loss, or damage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies must appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to ensure that all data protection regulations are adhered to, and employees are appropriately trained in data protection laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Staying Compliant:
To stay compliant with German data protection laws, businesses must ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the regulations and that they have implemented the necessary measures to protect personal data. Conducting regular audits, implementing appropriate data protection policies, and providing regular training for employees can help businesses stay compliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="protecting-personal-data-in-germany-key-considerations-for-businesses">Protecting Personal Data in Germany: Key Considerations for Businesses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Data protection laws are an important consideration for businesses operating in Germany. To protect personal data, companies must understand the legal requirements and regulations that apply to them. In this segment, we will discuss the key considerations for protecting personal data in Germany and how businesses can ensure compliance with data protection laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, businesses must understand the definition of personal data under German law. Personal data includes any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as their name, address, email, phone number, or IP address. Companies must obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, businesses must ensure the security of personal data. This includes implementing technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of personal data. Companies must also notify individuals and authorities in the event of a data breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirdly, businesses must appoint a data protection officer (DPO) to ensure compliance with data protection laws. The DPO is responsible for monitoring the company&amp;rsquo;s data protection practices and advising on any necessary changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, businesses must ensure compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been implemented in Germany. The GDPR requires businesses to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal data. Companies must also provide individuals with access to their personal data and the right to have it deleted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, protecting personal data is a crucial consideration for businesses operating in Germany. By understanding the legal requirements and regulations, implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, appointing a DPO, and ensuring compliance with the GDPR, companies can protect personal data and maintain the trust of their customers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data engineering involves a range of different activities, including data modeling, data integration, data storage, and data transformation. Data modeling is the process of designing the structure of the data, so it can be easily queried and analyzed. Data integration is the process of bringing together data from different sources, such as databases, applications, and APIs. Data storage involves choosing the right storage solutions, such as databases, data warehouses, or data lakes, to store the data. Data transformation is the process of converting the data from one format to another, to ensure it can be analyzed effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most critical components of data engineering is data pipelines. A data pipeline is a set of processes that moves data from its source to a destination, such as a database or data warehouse. Data pipelines can be built using a variety of tools and technologies, including Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda. A well-designed data pipeline can help ensure that data is stored efficiently and analyzed in a timely manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another key component of data engineering is ETL (extract, transform, load) processes. ETL processes involve extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a format that can be analyzed, and loading it into a data warehouse or other storage solution. ETL processes can be time-consuming and complex, but they are critical for ensuring that data is accurate and up-to-date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To optimize your data architecture, it is essential to follow best practices when designing and implementing your data engineering solutions. First, it is important to choose the right tools and technologies for the job. This means selecting tools that are efficient, scalable, and reliable, and that can handle the volume and variety of data you are working with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another best practice is to ensure that your data is well-structured and organized. This means using standardized naming conventions and data formats, and ensuring that data is stored in a consistent manner across all of your storage solutions. By keeping your data organized, you can make it easier to query and analyze, and ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it is important to monitor and optimize your data engineering solutions over time. This means tracking key performance metrics, such as data processing times and error rates, and making adjustments as needed to improve performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The DataFortress.cloud informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Newsletter-Tracking
The newsletter of the DataFortress.cloud contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the DataFortress.cloud may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The DataFortress.cloud automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Contact possibility via the website
The website of the DataFortress.cloud contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Comments function in the blog on the website
The DataFortress.cloud offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user’s (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="9">
&lt;li>Subscription to comments in the blog on the website
The comments made in the blog of the DataFortress.cloud may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="10">
&lt;li>Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="11">
&lt;li>Rights of the data subject
a) Right of confirmation
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>b) Right of access
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the purposes of the processing;
the categories of personal data concerned;

Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>c) Right to rectification
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.
The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the DataFortress.cloud, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of DataFortress.cloud shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of the DataFortress.cloud will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>e) Right of restriction of processing
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the DataFortress.cloud, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the DataFortress.cloud will arrange the restriction of the processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>f) Right to data portability
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the DataFortress.cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>g) Right to object
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DataFortress.cloud shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the DataFortress.cloud processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the DataFortress.cloud to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the DataFortress.cloud will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the DataFortress.cloud for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the DataFortress.cloud. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit consent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent, the DataFortress.cloud shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the DataFortress.cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the DataFortress.cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="12">
&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook
On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/&lt;/a>. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/&lt;/a>, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="13">
&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of functions of the Amazon Partner program
On this website, the controller has integrated Amazon components as a participant in the Amazon partner program. The Amazon components were created by Amazon with the aim to mediate customers through advertisements on various websites of the Amazon group, in particular Amazon.co.uk, Local.Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, BuyVIP.com, Amazon.de, Amazon.it and Amazon.es in return for the payment of a commission. By using the Amazon components, the controller may generate advertising revenue.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operating company of this Amazon component is Amazon EU S.à.r.l, 5 Rue Plaetis, L-2338 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amazon sets a cookie the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With each single call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and in which an Amazon component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Amazon through the respective Amazon component. During the course of this technical procedure, Amazon receives personal information that is used to trace the origin of orders from Amazon, and as a result, to allow the accounting of a commission. Among other things, Amazon may understand that the data subject has clicked on an affiliate link on our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used, and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Amazon from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Amazon may be deleted at anytime via a web browser or other software programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further information and the actual data protection provisions of Amazon may be retrieved under &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=3312401&amp;amp;language=en_GB">https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=3312401&amp;amp;language=en_GB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="14">
&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application &amp;ldquo;_gat. _anonymizeIp&amp;rdquo;. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link &lt;a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout&lt;/a> and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&lt;/a> and under &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html&lt;/a>. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">https://www.google.com/analytics/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="15">
&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords
On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google’s search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link &lt;a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads">www.google.de/settings/ads&lt;/a> and set the desired settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram
On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of LinkedIn
The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this website. LinkedIn is a web-based social network that enables users with existing business contacts to connect and to make new business contacts. Over 400 million registered people in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn. Thus, LinkedIn is currently the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operating company of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, UNITED STATES. For privacy matters outside of the UNITED STATES LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn. Further information about the LinkedIn plug-in may be accessed under &lt;a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins">https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins&lt;/a>. During the course of this technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn, LinkedIn detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our website, then LinkedIn assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the LinkedIn button or not. If such a transmission of information to LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their LinkedIn account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LinkedIn provides under &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls">https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls&lt;/a> the possibility to unsubscribe from e-mail messages, SMS messages and targeted ads, as well as the ability to manage ad settings.

&lt;li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of YouTube
On this website, the controller has integrated components of YouTube. YouTube is an Internet video portal that enables video publishers to set video clips and other users free of charge, which also provides free viewing, review and commenting on them. YouTube allows you to publish all kinds of videos, so you can access both full movies and TV broadcasts, as well as music videos, trailers, and videos made by users via the Internet portal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The operating company of YouTube is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding YouTube component. Further information about YouTube may be obtained under &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/">https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/&lt;/a>. During the course of this technical procedure, YouTube and Google gain knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the data subject is logged in on YouTube, YouTube recognizes with each call-up to a sub-page that contains a YouTube video, which specific sub-page of our Internet site was visited by the data subject. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>YouTube’s data protection provisions, available at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&lt;/a>, provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="19">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Period for which the personal data will be stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="installing-arch-linux-the-easy-way-with-encrypted-drives-for-deep-learning">Installing Arch Linux the easy way with encrypted drives for Deep Learning&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="the-benefits-of-arch-linux">The benefits of Arch Linux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my other post, &lt;a href="//www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-arch-linux-deeplearning-workstation/">“How To: Ditching Ubuntu in favor of Arch Linux for a Deep Learning Workstation”&lt;/a>, I have been explaining why I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux for my Machine Learning workstation. Summarized it is mostly because of speed, because Arch is way closer to the hardware and therefore way faster, less bloatware and therefore less RAM usage which I need to machine learning, and the amazing pacman and AUR packages which are fast and easy to install.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Ubuntu, for example, it is quite hard to get TensorFlow and CUDA working for Deep Learning, as the Debian package structure is different and the installation slower compared to Arch. In Arch, dependencies are handled nicely, and packages are not that abstracted as Arch is basically the “pure” Linux kernel itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally packages are coming out way faster, and the ArchWiki is said to be the most extensive documentation there is for an operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motto of Arch can be described as “Customize everything, and be as fast as possible”, whilst Ubuntu’s motto would be “Make the installation and usage as easy as possible for new users”. Now, I am not saying that Ubuntu is bad, because the community is huge, and it is the perfect Distro to start your journey into the world of Linux, but once you are more used to Linux and need more speed, Arch might be the best next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am at least happy with Arch, as it is way faster than everything I have seen before, and I can customize everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been thinking about providing an iso or img for my Deep Learning build for an easy install. If you are interested please comment or send me a message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, if you are fine with a slight abstraction layer &lt;a href="//manjaro.org/">Manjaro Arch&lt;/a> might be a good choice for you. It is basically Arch, but made easy and user-friendly. I loved it, but moved to Arch as Manjaro uses their own packages, which are still good, but not the same as the “pure” Arch packages. If you are not a power-user this might be the choice for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-install-arch-linux-the-easy-way">How to Install Arch Linux the easy way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whilst the &lt;a href="//wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">introductory guide&lt;/a> provided by arch is quite good already, it can be confusing for newcomers. That is why I have decided to write my own tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal has been to install Arch with encrypted drives, as I need to secure the data at rest for my clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-downloading-the-arch-linux-image">1. Downloading the Arch Linux Image&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Head over to &lt;a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">https://www.archlinux.org/download/&lt;/a> and download the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Write it to an USB stick. E.g. (but you can use your own program) for:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Linux:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>dd if=ISOFILE of=/dev/sdX status=progress&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Where the sdX is your usb stick. Check it with “lsblk”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows / Mac:
I liked to use Etcher &lt;a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">https://www.balena.io/etcher/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boot into the USB stick using your Boot menu (F11, F12 in most cases)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-first-setup-in-live-iso">2. First setup in Live ISO&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once you are in the Live ISO of Arch, you should see the basic command line of Arch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Not an US keyboard&lt;/strong>? Load your keys with:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>loadkeys KEYMAP&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Where Keymap is your locale. Get your locale with&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>localectl list-keymaps | grep -i SEARCHTERM&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>E.g. using the above command with SEARCHTERM = Germany returns de-latin1, for which the loadkeys command is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>loadkeys de-latin1&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(Optional) If you do not have ethernet you might have to connect to your wifi with the following commands. Replace WIFINETWORK and WIFIPASSWORD with your wifi name and password.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>wpa_passphrase &amp;lsquo;WIFINETWORK’ &amp;lsquo;WIFIPASSWORD&amp;rsquo; &amp;raquo; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf &lt;br>
wpa_supplicant -Bc /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -i &amp;lsquo;wlan0&amp;rsquo; &lt;br>
If the second command does not work your wifi device name might be different. You can check it with “ifconfig”
dhclient&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Check your connection with curling a website. If the response looks like HTML you are connected, if it says something along the lines of “404”, “timed out” or “no connection” repeat the above steps and watch for typos.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>curl &lt;a href="https://www.datafortress.cloud">www.datafortress.cloud&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="2-partitioning-the-drives">2. Partitioning the drives&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is the most difficult step, so once you are done with it you are almost done! I chose the more advanced version where the drive is completely encrypted for advanced security, but feel free to use the “&lt;a href="//wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning">standard method&lt;/a>” instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide will assume you are planning to wipe your whole drive. So be sure that all data is backed up. Of course, a dual-boot with windows or so is possible as well, but I will explain that in another guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plan is to have two partitions:
First partition: EFI boot drive - which tells your PC how to boot into Arch
Second partition: Completely encrypted drive with “sub”-drives containing the swap file, the root folder and a separate /home drive for security.
Why three partitions on the second drive? Let’s say you mess up your root installation. In that case your home folder with your documents, settings and so on will be on a separate partition and can easily be reused in a new install. Meaning you could install a fresh new Arch install in the root partition, and just “reuse” your home folder. Nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-1-get-the-name-of-your-drive">Step 1: Get the name of your Drive&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>lbslk -lh&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This shows you all connected drives. Usually your main drive should be called /dev/sda and your USB stick /dev/sdb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Check if sda is really your main drive according to the GB storage capacity and everything. If you simply copy and paste the following commands with sda you might wipe the wrong drive!!&lt;/strong>
That is why I will name the device sdX in the following paragraphs, but replace the X with your device number (a,b,c, …). Some drives are having different names, just compare and replace accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="step-2-partition">Step 2: Partition&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Start gdisk&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>gdisk /dev/sdX&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Boot EFI Drive Setup&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Type ‘o’ to create a partition table&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Type ‘n’ for a new partition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>+256M&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EF00
This will create a 256 mb partition with the EFI format that we need for booting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Encrypted Arch Drive setup&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Type ‘n’ to create a new partition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8309&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Check if everything looks right with pressing ‘p’. It should look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Number Start (sector) End (sector) Size Code Name &lt;br>
1 2048 1050623 256.0 MiB EF00 EFI System &lt;br>
2 1050624 242187466 115.0 GiB 8309 Linux LUKS&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Looks good? Press ‘w’ to write changes to disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-create-the-encrypted-filesystems">3. Create the encrypted filesystems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The partitions are empty right now. Next we will create the filesystems and encrypted “sub”-partitions. Remember to replace the X with your drive number (usually a).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX2 &lt;br>
cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 cryptlvm &lt;br>
pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm &lt;br>
vgcreate datafortress /dev/mapper/cryptlvm&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Feel free to replace the following disk sizes in front of the “G” for Gigabyte with your desired size. For Deep Learning Swap should be 32 Gb, for other cases around the size of your RAM. I recommend the root system to be 40Gb, but the minimum should be 10Gb.
You can replace datafortress with anything, or leave it as is to be the cool kid in town.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>lvcreate -L 16G datafortress -n swap &lt;br>
lvcreate -L 40G datafortress -n root &lt;br>
lvcreate -l +100%FREE datafortress -n home&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Create filesystems&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>mkfs.vat -F32 /dev/sdX1 &lt;br>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/datafortress-root &lt;br>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/datafortress-home &lt;br>
mkswap /dev/mapper/datafortress-swap&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Mount them&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>mount /dev/mapper/datafortress-root /mnt &lt;br>
mkdir /mnt/home &lt;br>
mkdir /mnt/boot &lt;br>
mount /dev/mapper/datafortress-home /mnt/home &lt;br>
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/boot &lt;br>
swapon /dev/mapper/datafortress-swap&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="4-install-base-linux">4. Install base Linux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before installing it is recommended to update your mirrorlist such that packages are downloaded from the closest mirrors. &lt;a href="//www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-arch-linux-deeplearning-workstation/">Head over to my other article and search for “reflector” for an instruction on how to do that&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware nano&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="5-install-fstab">5. Install Fstab&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Fstab is basically an instruction how to mount your drives. Just copy paste it for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>genfstab -U /mnt &amp;raquo; /mnt/etc/fstab&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="6-last-polishing-touches">6. Last polishing touches&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are going to chroot into our mount, which is basically like running sudo in our system.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>arch-chroot /mnt &lt;br>
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/REGION/CITY /etc/localtime&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Where Region is your region (just use tab to see the options if you types the /usr/…./zoneinfo/, like Europe, and CITY your city, like Vienna.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>hwclock &amp;ndash;systohc&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Set your hostname. The funny part when installing Arch is you get to do things Ubuntu and others do for you. Set the hostname for your device, e.g. if you are going to ssh into your device later you do not have to type an IP, but can use this name instead. E.g. “ssh user@hunneybunney” could be way nicer to remember than 192.168.0.231.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>echo NAME &amp;gt; /etc/hostname&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Next we are setting our locale, basically the system language. Open the file in nano and search for your language code. Use the UTF-8 version if possible. Searching with nano is possible using Strg + W. &lt;a href="//www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/">Nano tutorial&lt;/a>.
E.g. I wanted to have German and English (US), that is why I uncommented en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>nano /etc/locale.gen&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Generate locales&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>locale-gen&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(Optional) Now if you are using a non-US Keyboard add your keymap:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>echo KEYMAP &amp;gt; /etc/vconsole.conf&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Use the Keymap from the beginning, like de-latin1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next install some software. If you already know pacman packages you want to install, do it now. I recommend just using the minimum first and then continue installation of packages if everything works fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minimum&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -Syu &lt;br>
pacman -S wpa_supplicant dhclient lvm2 dialog&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installing a desktop environment&lt;/strong>
Feel free to install a desktop environment already, which allows you to have a GUI of everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install a display manager&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S lightdm&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now the benefits of Arch are choosing your own Desktop environment. For the looks choose Gnome, but it will be RAM hungry, for efficiency choose Xfce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Only install ONE of the following&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install GNOME:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S gnome gnome-extra&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To install Cinnamon:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S cinnamon nemo-fileroller&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To install XFCE:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To install KDE:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S plasma&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To install MATE:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>pacman -S mate mate-extra&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="7-adding-users">7. Adding users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recommend using different passwords for the root and default user.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>useradd -m -G wheel ‘USERNAME’ &lt;br>
passwd ‘USERNAME’&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Create a password for the root user&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>passwd&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You will login with your default user. If you need to do administrative stuff you can switch users with “su - root”&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="8-boot-configuration">8. Boot configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now there are a lot of boot managers, but I liked the systemd-boot loader the most. &lt;a href="//wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Boot_loaders">Feel free to choose another one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Search for the HOOKS line and edit it accordingly. Order matters!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard keymap consolefont modconf block encrypt lvm2 filesystems resume fsck)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Close and Save the file (Strg + X, y)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>mkinitcpio -p linux &lt;br>
bootctl install&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Edit your boot entries&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need the partition id of the encrypted drive. Usually this will be /dev/sda2, but can be different. It will not be the first 256mb drive, as this is the boot partition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check for the name and note it down, most likely it is /dev/sda2&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>lsblk -lh&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Then look for the UUID string in the output of following command at the device id /dev/sdX2&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>blkid&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can try the same command with a filter as well:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>blkid | grep UUID=&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Example UUID: 727cac18-044b-4504-87f1-a5aefa774bda&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
Add the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>title ArchLinux &lt;br>
linux /vmlinuz-linux &lt;br>
initrd /initramfs-linux.img &lt;br>
options cryptdevice=UUID=&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->:lvm:allow-discards resume=/dev/mapper/datafortress-swap root=/dev/mapper/datafortress-root rw quiet&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Remember to replace datafortress with the id you chose if you changed it. Otherwise leave as is.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="9-locking-up">9. Locking up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>DONE! Now reboot, remove the USB stick and hope everything worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>exit &lt;br>

&lt;p>Why should I store my data in the cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The computing industry has moved gradually away from local storage to remote, server-based storage and computing since the rise of the internet — what has been known as the cloud. Look at music and films: from media, we used to play them, and now they are downloaded from networks. Through storing your own data and media files in the cloud, you will enjoy the same benefits of viewing and uploading from anywhere. The advantages are increases in efficiency and decreased demands for local storage. We have rounded up the best providers for cloud storage and file-sharing or file synchronization to help you determine which one is right for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do not have a platform in the cloud to store and synchronize your data yet, you should consider it seriously. What you choose depends on the types of files that you save, how much protection you need, how you intend to share with others, and which gadgets you use to modify and view files. This may also usually rely on your level of comfort with computers. Some platforms are highly user-friendly while others provide advanced features for tech geeks who are more seasoned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The breadth of Web-based computing infrastructure capabilities is enormous. Most of them have been focused on a particular field. Dropbox and SugarSync, for instance, are focused on maintaining a synchronized folder available anywhere. SpiderOak stresses safety. Some cloud storage providers, such as Apple iCloud, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, are generalists providing not only folder and file synchronization but also multimedia play and system synchronization. These products also act as collaborative apps, which provide the coediting of documents in real-time.

&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Even though we are cautious in using the term “free” – as we all know nothing is free. But in offering some data of yourself whilst using these services, Google Drive and others offer a free quota of data for you to use. How do they use my data? Of course, there will not be a person at Google going through your personal diary, but the&lt;a href="https://safety.google/privacy/data/">y will use that data to construct an ad-profile&lt;/a>, which means that if you, for example, type an article about how much you love dogs, you might see ads for dog food soon after. For everyone that is okay with that, it is free data, so why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, as I will soon explain in another blog post, you can use apps like &lt;a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator (link)&lt;/a> to encrypt your data in the cloud (relatively) easily, meaning that the providers will not be able to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, our personal free Cloud Storage list goes as follows:

&lt;h3 id="heading">&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="heading-1">&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>pCloud might be an entry you have not heard before, which is good because like I said before, no free service is offered completely for free. pCloud values data privacy, which they guarantee through advanced encryption and storing data in Switzerland, meaning that they are outside of the jurisdiction of the NSA or European data regulations, meaning that no government can force them to give them your data. Why should I care if I have nothing to hide? Data can be used for advertisements, industrial espionage, determining your credit score, and much more if it is in the hands of criminal entities. Additionally, pCloud offers a lifetime subscription, which beats every other contestant on the list.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Google Drive is our number one selection for free cloud storage. It is available on many platforms and devices, offers 15 GB of free storage, and is amazingly fast. Furthermore, it offers many third-party applications to collaborate on data, and add almost any functionality you can think of.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/dropbox-150x150.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess everyone heard of Dropbox. The company laid a special focus on file synchronization, making it the service that avoids synchronization issues the best. Also, it has good integration into almost every operating system and is, therefore, the perfect set and forget solution. The problem? It is expensive and the free data is limited to 2GB only.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OneDrive is automatically installed if you are using Microsoft Windows, which is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems?oldformat=true">likely you are.&lt;/a> It is nicely integrated into Office 365, meaning you can easily share, edit and save data inbetween your OneNote Notebook, Outlook E-mail and others. Using additional apps you are able to do almost anything with it. You are already using Office 365 and Windows 10? Then search no further, you will receive 1 TB free storage and will have anything you need. Still remember that Microsoft had some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">privacy issues in the past, like handing over encrypted data to the NSA.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For users that want to have more control over their data, and seek more functionality or businesses we will recommend the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a business, you will need way more control over your data. You will need a log, being a registry where you “write down” what users accessed which files, which will become essential to control the data flow or to craft a report in case of a data breach. Additionally, you will have to limit which department or employee can access what kind of data. It would be bad if your employees would have access to salary data for example.&lt;br>
Many businesses underestimate the importance of cloud security, as we already have shown in our &lt;a href="https://www.datafortress.cloud/cloud-services/">post about cloud computing,&lt;/a> which causes millions in lost revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, if not for the fact of security, custom solutions are oftentimes way cheaper compared to the private use services stated above. AWS S3 can, for example, be a thousand times cheaper compared to the quota per GB above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.datafortress.cloud/contact/">Contact us for further details&lt;/a> about the following top three business cloud storage solutions&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A custom solution with for example AWS S3 is the best choice if you already imagine a perfect workflow for your company, or you are using specific products that you want to unify. Luckily, everything is customizable and it is easy to build a custom solution that is up to your security guidelines and requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="21-self-hosted-nextcloud--best-business-cloud-storages--advanced-usershttpsnextcloudcom">&lt;a href="https://nextcloud.com/">2.1. Self-Hosted NextCloud – Best Business Cloud Storages / Advanced Users&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>NextCloud is an open-source self-hosted solution for storing data in the cloud. Being open-source, the security risk of malicious code in the product is minimal, and there are already thousands of extensions that are all for free. The broad range of developers furthermore implemented state-of-the-art security measures to truly protect your data. And the best part about open source is that it is fully customizable. We at DataFortress.cloud use it for example as a serverless data storage solution in combination with S3, and can limit it to our IP range because it is self-hosted. Definitely our best choice and basically free aside from server costs.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="how-can-i-ensure-the-security-and-compliance-of-my-data-in-the-cloud">How can I ensure the security and compliance of my data in the cloud?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The cloud offers many advantages, but the security and compliance of data can be a concern. This article explores the key concepts of cloud security and compliance, including the types of threats that can affect cloud data, different security models, and the regulations that businesses must comply with. Discover the best practices for securing your data and ensuring compliance, and learn about the importance of ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement in cloud security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-cloud-data-security-and-compliance">Understanding Cloud Data Security and Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way companies store, access, and manage data. However, it also presents new challenges when it comes to data security and compliance. In this segment, we will provide an overview of cloud security and compliance concepts and regulations and explain why cloud security is different from traditional IT security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud data can be vulnerable to a variety of threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. To mitigate these risks, different cloud security models have been developed, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models offer varying levels of control and responsibility for data security, and it is important for businesses to understand the implications of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compliance regulations play a crucial role in ensuring the protection of sensitive data in the cloud. Major regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Each regulation has specific requirements that must be met, and non-compliance can result in significant fines and legal consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One major difference between cloud security and traditional IT security is the shared responsibility model. Under this model, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for securing the data and applications they store on the cloud. This means that businesses need to implement proper security controls and monitoring to ensure the safety of their data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="identifying-risks-and-threats">Identifying Risks and Threats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges of cloud data security is the constantly evolving threat landscape. In order to effectively protect your data, you need to be aware of the potential risks and threats that your business faces in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the most common security risks in the cloud include data breaches, insider threats, and cyber-attacks. Data breaches can occur when sensitive information is accessed or stolen by unauthorized users. Insider threats refer to the risk of data theft or sabotage by employees or other insiders. Cyber-attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system or network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these risks, businesses also need to be aware of compliance risks in the cloud. Failure to comply with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS can result in significant fines and damage to a business&amp;rsquo;s reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also several different threat actors that can compromise data security in the cloud. These include hackers, cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and even insiders such as disgruntled employees. Each of these threat actors has different motivations and capabilities, and businesses need to be aware of the potential risks that each poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To effectively manage these risks and protect their data in the cloud, businesses need to implement robust security and compliance programs. This includes using the latest security technologies, regularly monitoring and auditing data access, and providing ongoing training and awareness to employees. By identifying and mitigating potential risks and threats, businesses can help ensure the security and integrity of their data in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="strategies-for-cloud-data-security-and-compliance">Strategies for Cloud Data Security and Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Implementing best practices for securing cloud data and ensuring compliance with industry regulations and standards is essential for businesses that operate in the cloud. One of the most critical steps to protect cloud data is to implement appropriate security measures like encryption, identity and access management, and network security. Encryption helps to protect data from unauthorized access, while identity and access management ensure that only authorized personnel can access the data. Network security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems can help to prevent cyber-attacks and data breaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to implementing security measures, it is crucial to comply with industry regulations and standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Compliance requirements include data governance, risk assessments, and audit and reporting. For example, GDPR requires businesses to have explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal data, while HIPAA mandates that healthcare providers protect the privacy and security of their patients&amp;rsquo; data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, businesses should prioritize ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement in cloud security and compliance. Regular vulnerability scanning and patching can help to identify and address potential security threats, while monitoring access logs and user behavior can help detect and prevent unauthorized access to cloud data. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices and compliance requirements to ensure the safety and privacy of cloud data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-security-monitoring-and-management">Cloud Security Monitoring and Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud Security Monitoring and Management are critical components of any successful cloud security strategy. By implementing the right tools and technologies, identifying and responding to security incidents in the cloud, and ensuring ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement, businesses can help protect their cloud data from potential threats and remain in compliance with industry regulations and standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As more businesses move to the cloud, the challenge of balancing cost and performance optimization becomes increasingly critical. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the strategies and best practices for cutting cloud costs without sacrificing performance, including rightsizing, automation, and cost monitoring. With these tips, you can maximize cost efficiency and get the most out of your cloud investment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="maximizing-cost-efficiency-in-the-cloud-tips-and-strategies-for-businesses">Maximizing Cost Efficiency in the Cloud: Tips and Strategies for Businesses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses operate, providing access to vast computing resources at a fraction of the cost of traditional on-premise infrastructure. However, as companies increasingly move their workloads to the cloud, cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control. In this segment, we will explore some tips and strategies for maximizing cost efficiency in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most effective ways to optimize cloud costs is through rightsizing. This involves matching the size of cloud resources, such as virtual machines and storage, to the actual needs of the application. Overprovisioning resources can lead to unnecessary costs, while underprovisioning can result in performance issues. Cloud providers offer tools to help rightsize resources, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to regularly review and adjust them as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Automation is another key strategy for reducing cloud costs. By automating routine tasks such as backups, scaling, and provisioning, businesses can reduce the need for manual intervention and minimize the risk of errors. This can also help ensure that resources are used only when they are needed, further reducing costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cost monitoring is also critical for maximizing cost efficiency in the cloud. By keeping a close eye on cloud costs, businesses can identify inefficiencies and take corrective action before costs spiral out of control. Cloud providers offer tools to monitor and manage costs, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to regularly review cost reports and make adjustments as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Best practices for managing cloud costs also include creating a cloud cost management plan and conducting regular cost reviews. A cost management plan should include clear cost allocation rules, usage policies, and guidelines for resource optimization. Regular cost reviews can help ensure that the plan is being followed and identify areas for further optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-balancing-act-how-to-cut-cloud-costs-without-compromising-performance">The Balancing Act: How to Cut Cloud Costs Without Compromising Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s business landscape, cloud computing has become a go-to solution for many organizations to enhance agility and flexibility while cutting costs. However, finding the right balance between cost and performance can be a challenge. In this segment, we will explore the importance of identifying the right balance between cost and performance and provide tips and strategies to cut cloud costs without compromising performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the critical challenges businesses face when implementing cloud solutions is the potential for cost escalation, especially when cloud resources are not correctly sized or managed. Cost optimization is crucial in avoiding unexpected charges, and companies can achieve this by creating a cloud cost management plan, setting budget limits, and conducting regular cost reviews. Additionally, businesses should consider adopting cloud cost management tools that can provide detailed insights into their cloud usage and help identify potential cost-saving opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to cost management, cloud performance optimization is equally essential. There is a need to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining optimum performance levels. The right cloud performance optimization strategy can help organizations maintain optimal performance levels while cutting costs. These strategies may include workload optimization, performance tuning, and caching. In workload optimization, businesses can prioritize essential workloads while deprioritizing or suspending non-critical ones. Performance tuning involves fine-tuning the infrastructure to improve overall performance, while caching reduces the need for server requests, thereby improving overall performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-cost-performance-conundrum-solving-your-cloud-optimization-challenges">The Cost-Performance Conundrum: Solving Your Cloud Optimization Challenges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Optimizing cloud costs is crucial for businesses, as it can result in significant cost savings while still maintaining optimal performance. However, there are challenges that businesses face when trying to optimize their cloud costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main challenges is managing the complexity of cloud pricing and billing structures. The cloud has numerous pricing options and payment models that can be challenging to understand and manage. Additionally, businesses need to consider the varying costs associated with different cloud services, such as storage, bandwidth, and computing resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s essential to monitor and manage cloud costs regularly to optimize performance while keeping costs under control. Setting up cost control tools and creating cost policies can help businesses avoid unexpected charges and identify potential cost-saving opportunities. Regular audits can also help ensure that businesses are only paying for what they need and use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, optimizing cloud performance is also crucial for businesses to achieve their desired outcomes. Methods such as workload optimization, performance tuning, and caching can help businesses maximize their cloud investments and improve their overall performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="optimizing-your-cloud-spend-best-practices-for-maximizing-roi">Optimizing Your Cloud Spend: Best Practices for Maximizing ROI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To optimize your cloud spend and maximize ROI, start by defining clear objectives and creating a cloud cost management plan that aligns with your business goals. This plan should include regular cost reviews, setting up cost control tools, and creating cost policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, explore various cloud cost optimization strategies, including utilizing automation, adopting pay-as-you-go pricing models, and taking advantage of reserved instances. Rightsizing is another key factor that businesses need to consider to optimize their cloud spend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important aspect of cloud optimization is performance tuning. This involves workload optimization, choosing the right cloud provider, and using performance optimization tools and techniques.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure that your cloud optimization efforts are successful, regular monitoring and management are crucial. This includes setting up alerts for cost overruns and conducting regular audits to identify cost-saving opportunities.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="meet-our-brand-new-solution">Meet Our Brand New Solution&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I, Justin Güse, am the founder of &lt;strong>Datafortress.cloud&lt;/strong>. After working for Porsche Holding in an &lt;strong>innovation/data science division&lt;/strong>, where I developed many projects ranging from Big Data to Virtual Reality (see &lt;a href="https://datafortress.cloud/project">portfolio&lt;/a>), I decided to found my own company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my time at Porsche, I observed that many agencies or consultants &lt;strong>do not have the main goal to satisfy their clients’ needs&lt;/strong> as the main priority, but rather how to achieve the minimal needed tasks in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consultants were analyzing the situation but left us alone when it came to the application or the development. Oftentimes agencies struggled because the person executing a project is different from a consultant, which caused a lot of confusion and errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is my belief, that great projects can only be achieved if an &lt;strong>agency both plans/consults a partner, and offers the execution, or at least recommended partners as well&lt;/strong>. We will not just propose an insane plan and leave the execution to someone else – we plan thoroughly what is possible and how it can become a reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, it is my belief, that if I will &lt;strong>take the extra mile&lt;/strong> to fully satisfy a contract, that we can establish a &lt;strong>trust-based relationship&lt;/strong> and maybe even start new projects together with the budget that might be saved due to our cooperation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cloud &amp; Kubernetes</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/services/cloud/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 11:54:02 +0600</pubDate><author/><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/services/cloud/</guid><description>

&lt;h1 id="cloud-computing">Cloud Computing&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are looking for digital transformation for your company, you can engage with the Cloud offering holistic end-to-end computing services. Undoubtedly, Cloud computing offers a phenomenal delivery of computing services like networking, database, software, intelligence, analysis, storage, and servers. As a matter of fact, it is the smooth transition of conventional on-premise infrastructure to contemporary computing to companies looking for economies of scale, innovation, and flexible resources. Moreover, you will have to pay merely for its services you utilize and thereby lower your operating budget and run your infrastructure quite efficiently with the appropriate scaling of your business needs. In fact, you need not worry as regards the operational costs concerning staff training, equipment purchasing, and ongoing maintenance because these all are managed by cloud computing itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-cloud-computing">Types of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Considering the varied needs of businesses and individuals, several various distinct types, services, and models have developed gradually in due course of time. The different types of cloud computing have evolved to address the precise and appropriate solution considering the desired needs. You need to ascertain what type of cloud computing or deployment is required to be implemented at the very outset. In this connection, the following three types of cloud computing can be deployed and operated according to your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-public-cloud">1. Public Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Public Clouds are managed by cloud service providers being the third party and sole operator. All computing resources, including servers and storage on the internet, are provided by cloud service providers. As a matter of fact, the Public Cloud is operated and owned by cloud computing. You can avail of computing services like all software, hardware, and other infrastructure. It means all computing resources are managed in data centers instead of maintaining them on-premise. Thus, it consists of many companies using the same infrastructure. A few renowned hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft (Azure), Google cloud, and Alicloud dealing with massive scale as the largest cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-private-cloud">2. Private Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Private Cloud is more efficacious and better for those companies that want to share their resources on a Public cloud. In fact, the servers of these cloud models are owned and controlled by the companies themselves. This is accessed using the internet or a private network. This Cloud provides you an environment whereby you control the security and data, ensuring specific monitoring and other requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-hybrids-cloud">3. Hybrids Cloud:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As Hybrid Cloud suggests, it is the combination of several clouds. A few companies prefer to use a combination of cloud environments. This use of cloud combination environment is known as a Hybrid cloud model. The hybrid cloud approach typically combines private and public clouds that can share their data amongst them. The provision of sharing applications and data amongst the private and public clouds makes the business more flexible with extensive development options. Undoubtedly, this assists in maximizing your current infrastructure, especially compliance and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-cloud-services">Types of Cloud Services:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Generally, there are four types of Cloud services. These types are also called the cloud computing stack owing to their designed structure building on one another. If you want to accomplish your goal with ease, you have to understand these four categories, particularly as to how and what they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Iaas is the most rudimentary type of cloud computing. If you opt for this service, you will rent IT infrastructure. Your rent infrastructure includes storage, networks, virtual machines and servers, and an operating system. This infrastructure service is obtained based on a pay-as-you-go from a cloud computing provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-platform-as-a-service-paas">2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want an environment in respect of testing, developing, managing, and delivering distinct software applications, you will have to seek PaaS, a cloud computing services. In fact, the PaaS helps developers to make mobile apps, or different webs easily. Moreover, this platform also makes it easier to develop apps without any infrastructure of the database, storage, and servers required for the development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-serverless-computing">3. Serverless Computing:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Serverless computing extends over the PaaS, and it focuses on developing applications without spending sufficient time controlling the infrastructure needed to carry out. This cloud service manages server management, capacity development, and other set-ups. Its good characteristics are its architectures highly scalable that use resources only at a specific action.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-software-as-a-service-saas">4. Software as a Service (SaaS):&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is used commonly by a business to approach software applications. If you have SaaS, you can access a specific software app managed on a distant server. In fact, it is used on a subscription basis. In this respect, a web browser is used to access a remote server hosted by a third-party service provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-benefits-of-cloud-computing">The Benefits of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is no denying that Cloud computing has transformed the traditional style of business into a digital on-sign environment. There is a host of benefits of cloud computing, due to which a huge number of companies are approaching cloud computing services. You can also avail of these services awash with numerous benefits by visiting our website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-cost">1. Cost:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It does away with your company&amp;rsquo;s operating cost, such as software and hardware purchases. Moreover, it would be best if you had not incurred the capital expenses regarding the electricity for power, the frames of servers, and the IT professionals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-speed">2. Speed:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The computing services are provided expeditiously, thereby making the business quite flexible. Therefore, a business having such benefits and flexibility can take the pressure off many things.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-scaling">3. Scaling:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Scaling is a huge advantage of cloud computing. Cloud computing using new technologies provides a way of automatic and digitalized scaling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-security">4. Security:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is more secure than many on-premise systems. Many on-premise system environments are set up once and never revisited, causing several security hazards. On the other hand, the cloud computing service providers keep constantly updating the serverless computing system particularly.
Besides, there are many other benefits like reliability, matchless performance, and efficacious productivity you can get using incomparable services of cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uses-of-cloud-computing">Uses of Cloud Computing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud computing is regarded and admired for its competitiveness using distinct and glaring cost reduction, optimal use of resources, alluring flexibility, and of course, its elasticity. Following are the efficient uses of cloud computing, enhancing the capabilities to accomplish your business goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>One can develop a cloud-native application. He or she can use this app for mobile, web, and API, taking advantage of cloud-native approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Test and development environment is also one of the uses of a cloud. This encompasses saving you on-premise, reducing a budget volume, and creating an environment for your business through the crucial workforce, physical assets, and precious time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Big data analytics is significant to use of cloud computing whereby one can manage huge quantities of either kind of structured as well as unstructured data. This can be used to harness the advantage of drawing out business value.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is yet another benefit to extricate using cloud computing is the cost-effectiveness in respect of a disaster recovery way out. This gives an expeditious recovery against interlaced physical sites, especially at lower expenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In addition to these discussed uses, there are a few more common uses like cloud storage, data backup, hybrid and multicolored, streaming audio and video, embed intelligence, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion-on-cloud-computing">Conclusion on cloud computing:&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before Cloud service providers, companies would confront various problems, and they had to use hard devices like servers and drives for data and software storage. But the cloud computing has transformed cumbersome traditional on-sight infrastructure into the digital computing system using the internet. Today, companies can adapt and scale at a swift speed, drive business with accelerated innovation.

You might say to yourself “of course, there are many opportunities that I could follow with my company, why data?” – but one thing that should not be underestimated with data is that it is not just a small improvement of your product gaining 0.X % increase in sales, it is rather a transition of your company into the data-driven age, times X-ing your revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="br">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="example-1-ford-automotive">Example 1: Ford automotive&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As an example, let us have a look at the Ford automotive company. In 2006 their annual loss has been 12,6 billion USD. After that, a data scientist has been brought in to overhaul the company in the next three years into a more data-driven company. The result has been 2,3 million cars sold in 2009 and is in the green by the end of the year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Timing supply chain resources can be the deciding factor for a win or loss. To have the factory ready if a delivery arrives, or to avoid employees being idle are some factors that can be optimized with data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pitt Ohio Freight Company utilized data science to estimate the arrival of their drivers with a 99% accuracy rate, which increased their customers that much, that they gained another 50,000 USD a year by repeated orders. &lt;a href="https://conceptainc.com/blog/how-data-science-can-help-your-enterprise-generate-more-revenue/">(Source: T.

&lt;h3 id="example-3-programmatic-advertising">Example 3: Programmatic Advertising&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using the information a company has about future or existing customers can leverage new revenue streams for previously undiscovered target groups or better targeting of ad spends. Traditional advertisements have a bad targeting, as all the people driving past a billboard, for example, might or might not see the ad, no matter if it is fitting or not. This is one the one hand quite expensive, as billboards cost a lot of money, and due to the fact that the average person is spammed by hundreds of ads a day, their attention span is really limited nowadays. What if we could just show our ad to the people that are most likely to be our customers, and target them with personalized information that fits their needs?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the classic “shooting a cannon at a bird” example. Billboards are like shooting a cannon at a small sparrow to catch it. I mean it works, but it also spends a lot of money on cannons, might injure a lot of other animals and is a huge effort. Why not use bait that targets sparrows specifically to catch only sparrows and it precisely?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The Economist”, an established print and online media, used programmatic advertising to drive potential unsure readers to finally subscribe. Their initial hopes were to gain 650’000 new customers. They used a combination of information they already had, plus derived information from geolocation, IP’s and several other information to show advertisements to “mirrored customers”, meaning potential new customers that are similar to existing ones. They identified their main segments in their publications, like “Finance”, “Politics”, “Careers” and others, and produced matching content which was then shown to the segmented mirrored customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results of this campaign have been astonishing. The goal of 650’000 customers was bet 5 times over, with 3,6 million new customers. Their newly gained lifetime value is estimated to be £11,970,000 (14,8 million USD), which is a return of invest (ROI) of 10:1. Furthermore, awareness for “The Economist” has been raised by almost 65%.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="what-is-a-data-lake">What is a Data Lake?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data lakes are essential for your Big Data landscape. In order to centralize all your data sources, be it SQL-databases, images, text data, E-mail, SAP, and others, an intermediate layer needs to be established in between your data science team and the data itself.&lt;br>
This layer manages communication between these different data structures, access control (who can access what), lifetime-policies (how long is data stored, data catalogs), and the security of these interactions (logging of access, security measures, timely-limited access, …).&lt;br>
The goal is to basically establish a “front-end” for all your data needs. Employees will be able to only access the data they are allowed to, where the access will be logged for forensics if needed, and can “load” them into their data analytics tools. A centralized gives both an overview of existing data and avoids building up several data “silos” or unnecessary duplicates in your company.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-is-data-engineering">What is Data Engineering?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data scientists should focus on their data analytic processes. But given the 80/20 data science dilemma, data scientists spend 80% of their time with data preparation instead of applying their algorithms (&lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html" title="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html">https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html&lt;/a>). If Jupyterhub &amp;amp; other tools are correctly set up on top of a data lake this time can be drastically reduced, which includes using the right tools, latency reduction, and usage of the right storage version for the matching use case.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-is-etl--data-processing">What is ETL / Data Processing?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Another time-consuming step in data science is to take the data in its raw form (e.g. SQL data) and preprocess it into a form that makes it usable. This is called ETL, being short for Extract, Transform, Load. A good big data system automates these steps as best as possible, e.g. that to prepare data for the data scientists in the morning, huge cloud-driven machines start-up in the night, take the raw data, prepare it and save it ready to be analyzed in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-are-serverless-databases">What are Serverless Databases?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>SQL databases can be a pain to manage. Additionally, many companies do not employ effective backup solutions in case a server goes down. More than often, unexpected traffic peaks can crash a product, because classic SQL servers do not scale with the demand needed. This can easily be avoided with the usage of cloud, or hybrid-cloud (on-premise and cloud) scenarios.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="what-are-speed-first-websites">What are Speed-First Websites?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Our focus when building websites is speed. BBC reported losing 10% of customers for every second their website takes to load.&lt;br>

Additionally, 53% of mobile users abandon the website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load (&lt;a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/" title="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/">https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/&lt;/a>).&lt;br>
Of course, the look and design of a website are important as well, but in the last years, looks became more important than loading times. The problem is, that if the website loads slowly the user will not even see your website. Therefore it is of uttermost importance to speed up websites because even apart from being favored by customers, they also rank higher on Google searches. We can do this using several serverless architectures, content delivery systems, and special settings to speed up content delivery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Financial Data-driven Planning</title><link>https://datafortress.cloud/services/financial-data-driven-planning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 11:51:17 +0600</pubDate><author/><guid>https://datafortress.cloud/services/financial-data-driven-planning/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="financial-data-driven-planning">Financial Data-driven Planning&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Nowadays people become to understand the importance of data for their business. The only problem is, that many companies are overwhelmed by the amount of it, or do not have the &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-albanese/are-you-making-these-costly-data-analysis-mistakes.html">time or resources to take a deep-dive into the data.&lt;/a>&lt;br>
But using this data could bring enormous benefits in the form of saved costs, process improvements, increased advertisement efficiency, and generally increased sales.&lt;br>
According to a &lt;a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/hadoop-is-datas-darling-for-a-reason/">Forrester report&lt;/a>, 60 percent and 73 percent of all data within an enterprise is not used for analytics and remains stored on some hard drive never to be seen again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we are taking a look at your data our company follows two basic principles yielding vast improvements in your business:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="financial-planning-strategies">FINANCIAL PLANNING STRATEGIES&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="1-cost-reduction">1. Cost Reduction&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The first principle is cost reduction. We will take a look at your data to identify processes or areas where costs can be saved, or which areas could be optimized using either technology, HR, or delivery chain changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h4 id="2-increase-sales-and-revenue">2. Increase sales and revenue&lt;/h4>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The second step includes identifying unseen opportunities in your data, or target demographics for your products that remain unseen in your data. This can include but is not limited to ad targeting, programmatic advertising, core customer identification, new sales channel generations, or increasing revenue of existing top sales channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="identifying-hidden-opportunities">Identifying hidden opportunities&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Combining and identifying all your available data is a complex task, consisting of analyzing whether your stored data can be processed at all given law and regulations, transforming them into a usable format, using the right tools to process big data, and finally almost most importantly visualizing and discussing the findings.&lt;br>
We do not simply do our reports in a black box sending you a final email, we rather understand that your business is complex and can only be analyzed using our data background and your business knowledge. Let us work together to solve these milestones on your journey to greater revenue and cost optimization&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Data regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, …)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creation of a data catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combining several sources to make the data usable (e.g. into a Data Lake)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access regulation and logging (security)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Being a lean startup ourselves we are experts in constantly rethinking our business using data, the newest tools, and trying new experimental business fields.&lt;br>
As a business owner, you might be thinking about how you could enhance, or speed up some processes, or increase the potential of your HR. We have worked with several different business fields and try to stay an agile company, therefore we might have experienced the perfect solution for your problems already.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="our-lean-business-approach">Our Lean Business Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>As a business in the area of new technology, a lean mindset is essential.&lt;br>
Enterprises oftentimes execute decisions affecting a large portion of their business without measuring the effect and minimizing damage.&lt;br>
The goal of a lean company is to take many small iterative steps, or prototypes before implementing a great change in the company and constantly measure and evaluate data.&lt;br>
For example, when implementing a new feature on our website we are doing A/B tests (showing x-percent of customers our page A, and x-percent of customers page B), measure values (in this case for example bounce rate and conversions) and finally decide if we should implement this feature or not – and all that in days.&lt;br>
If something does not work our business is not heavily affected, and we can pass on a new feature without huge losses, if it works, we can further enhance the feature or test it on a larger portion of our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process can be summarized into three simple steps, that are constantly running in an automated fashion:&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/bulb-1.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are new ways that your business could try? Are there hidden opportunities? New demographics? Should an area in your business be decreased in favour of another? The goal of this step is to formulate a goal or specific idea that will be tested in the next steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="2-execute">2. Execute&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/creators.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of a lean company is to stay flexible and try the ideas formulated beforehand as fast as possible. Measure the progress on the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/business-1.webp" alt="">&lt;br>
In this step, the data gathered before is analyzed, and if your measured value statistically significantly increased, the new feature is implemented and new ideas on top of this feature are generated (step 1).&lt;br>
Finally, the process starts again from the beginning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unraceable is the name of a &lt;strong>virtual reality motionseat&lt;/strong> project and &lt;strong>App&lt;/strong> that I managed for three years.&lt;br>
The idea has been to enhance showrooms and build something that gives people an emotional experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The main campaign spot of “Audi #unraceable”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The requirement should be an improvement to the “Audi Sandbox”, which was produced by Audi Norway, as you can see in the following video.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge">THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first milestone of the product had a strict timeline and demanded that customers build their race-track in a sandbox, which gets scanned, and finally transferred to a virtual reality motion seat.&lt;br>
The “Audi Sandbox” had the problem, that it did not feature a motion seat and the “scanning” process has been mostly manual and took a lot of time. As the project should be presented at a fair, the scanning process could only take a maximum of some minutes, which means a new automated way to create this track had to be found.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strategy">THE STRATEGY&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the project, we worked together with a partner and experimented with several ways to make this idea become reality. For the scanning, an Xbox Kinect has been chosen, as it can both scan depth imagery (3D topography), as well as the color 2D image of the track. With this information, a map was generated in seconds (reducing complexity for time), and together with object scanning from the 2D image data objects could be placed on the 3D map as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fulfill the motion seat part, we scouted several solutions and finally decided to go with a 6 DOF motion simulator produced in the Czech republic. As it has not been equipped with Virtual Reality, the VR technology had to be fitted onto it.&lt;br>
This poses a huge problem, as traditional trackers are irritated by the motion seat-movement, as they can not distinguish if the head or the seat is moving. A customized solution was needed and involved fitting another tracker to the seat, and calculating the spacial difference of the seat, base stations and VR glasses in realtime. As VR glasses the HTC Vive has been chosen, as it offered the best resolution at that time. But a huge problem in VR is lag. If calculations of the scene take too long, and the image is slightly delayed to the movement of the motion seat, people feel motion-sick. This phenomenon is often called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness?oldformat=true">virtual reality sickness&lt;/a>” or “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness?oldformat=true">cybersickness&lt;/a>“. Therefore, the next steps involved trying several techniques to reduce motion sickness.&lt;br>
#unraceable has been featured in several magazines, and even appeared in “Austria’s Next Topmodel” as a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the final fair, #unraceable has been a great success and offered the production of several other milestones.&lt;br>
In the following year, it even appeared in a modified version at the worldwide “Formula E” traveling around the globe together with team “Audi Sport ABT”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/img_1286-768x576.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="milestone-2-unraceable-app-and-quattro-challenge">Milestone 2: #unraceable App and Quattro-Challenge&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The previous success allowed for further development of the project and an App should be produced to reach a broader mass. The idea has been, that four skiing stars (Quattro, like the “Audi Quattro”) should each build a track, which was then to be raced by gamers around the globe, with the final winner winning an Audi A1 for a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/9f01d087dae1e9abb8a2f8c125c7329a-768x555.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The track should be both playable on the simulator, as well as the app itself. Several changes were needed to achieve this, especially porting a high-quality VR game to a mobile game which only allows for limited resources. Several anti-cheat mechanisms had to be implemented, and new data privacy challenges had to be solved. In the end, the app had been downloaded more than 30’000 times reaching a review of 4,3/5 stars.&lt;br>
As a link to the car configurator of Audi had been integrated into the game, an enormous conversion rate has been achieved as almost 50% of gamers opened the car configurator at least once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/img_3777-768x432.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.audi.at/audi-erleben/unraceable">Link: Download the App&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="milestone-3-unraceable-ski-challenge">Milestone 3: #unraceable Ski-Challenge&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The next step has been to cooperate with the Austrian Skiing Association (&lt;a href="https://www.oesv.at/" title="https://www.oesv.at/">https://www.oesv.at/&lt;/a>) and build something similar to the former “Skiing Challenge” that experienced great success in the past years. But the task has been to not simply emulate this success but to build something new. The idea was to drive up the skiing track (Hahnenkamm) with an Audi e-Tron (in similarity to the then Audi e-Tron spot where it drives up a skiing track like in the first “Quattro” spot) and then drive it down again using a skier. Again the app has been downloaded more than 30’000 times and is still being played today.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="how-to-ditching-ubuntu-in-favor-of-arch-linux-for-a-deep-learning-workstation">How To: Ditching Ubuntu in favor of Arch Linux for a Deep Learning Workstation&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="why-should-i-ditch-ubuntu">Why should I ditch Ubuntu?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most of you might be using Ubuntu for their workstations, and that is fine for the more inexperienced users. One of the issues I had with Ubuntu and the Tensorflow/CUDA though, has been that handling the different drivers and versions of CUDA, cudnn, TensorFlow, and so on has been quite a struggle. I’m not sure about you, but once I had a working Tensorflow 1.15 or 2.0 environment, I usually did not touch it anymore being scared to mess up this holy configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with different programs it would be nice to have a way of switching between the two most used TensorFlow versions of 1.15 and 2.0 like you can do with Google Colab in a single command, but installing a different TensorFlow version usually messed up my system again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, Arch has always been on my To-Do list, as it is the most “barebone” Linux distro you can get, meaning you are working way closer on the hardware compared to “higher abstractions” like Ubuntu. In their own words, Ubuntu is built to “work out of the box and make the installation process as easy as possible for new users”, whilst the motto of Arch Linux is “customize everything”.
Being way closer to the hardware Arch is insanely faster compared to Ubuntu (and miles ahead of Windows), for the cost of more Terminal usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I have been using Arch in the past weeks, RAM usage usually halved compared to Ubuntu, and installing Machine Learning packages is a breeze. I can have both TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0 working together, switching the versions with Anaconda environments. Also, the system works quite stable, as I am using the LTS (long term support) kernels of Linux, and usually updates to the famous AUR (user-made packages in Arch) are coming out a month ahead of the Debian (Ubuntu) packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I can only recommend setting up an Arch Linux Deep Learning station as it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Faster, like packages will install super fast, deep learning is supercharged, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More stable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easier to switch between TensorFlow versions
compared to Ubuntu.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I will split the how-to in two parts, the first one being “How to I install Arch Linux” and the second one being “How to install the Deep Learning workstation packages”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the general &lt;a href="//www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-install-arch-linux-the-easy-way/">“How to install Arch Linux”, head over to this article&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If Arch is too complex for now, you could try out &lt;a href="//manjaro.org/">Manjaro&lt;/a>, which is a user-friendly version of Arch, even though I can not guarantee that all packages will work the same, as they are slightly different. All in all it should work the same though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was thinking about creating a ready to install Image (iso or img), if enough people are interested leave a comment below or message me!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-the-deep-learning-tensorflow-cuda-cudnn-anaconda-setup-on-a-fresh-arch-linux-installation">Installing the Deep Learning (TensorFlow, CUDA, CUDNN, Anaconda) setup on a fresh Arch Linux installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you are &lt;a href="//www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-install-arch-linux-the-easy-way/">done with the Arch installation (phew!)&lt;/a>, let us first change some settings such that our system works more stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-switching-to-the-fastest-mirrors">1. Switching to the fastest mirrors&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software is downloaded from so-called “mirrors”, which are servers containing all the Arch libraries. If not done automatically, it could happen that your servers are not optimized yet. Therefore, we are going to install a small tool that finds and saves the fastest servers called “reflector”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install reflector using&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -S reflector&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Find and download the best servers&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>reflector &amp;ndash;verbose -l 20 -n 20 &amp;ndash;sort rate &amp;ndash;save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Check the output if it makes sense, e.g. if the domains are close to your location. If not, you could add the country tag to get more precise results, e.g. for Germany and Austria:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>reflector -c “AT,DE” &amp;ndash;verbose -l 20 -n 20 &amp;ndash;sort rate &amp;ndash;save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Update your installation&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -Syyu&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="2-changing-the-desktop-environment">2. Changing the Desktop Environment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you are using Manjaro or chose the “Gnome” Desktop environment as you know it from Ubuntu, it might be worth it to think about changing it as Gnome is known to eat more RAM than Chrome, and we surely need RAM in our Deep Learning setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you like Gnome, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, I can recommend the Xfce desktop as it is a good combination of lightweight and full of features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download Xfce&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies lxdm&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Lxdm is a display manager that allows you to use multiple desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log out of your current session and press Alt + F2 (or Alt + F3 if it does not work) to get a terminal. First disable Gnome and afterward “activate” Xfce:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deactivate and uninstall gnome:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo systemctl disable gdm &lt;br>
sudo pacman -R gnome gnome-extras&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Activate Xfce&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo systemctl enable lxdm &lt;br>
sudo systemctl start lxdm&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If the new Xfce desktop does open just login and explore, if not try to reboot (sudo reboot). If that does not help proceed to crying and rolling on the floor, and send me a message or comment afterward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-installing-the-lts-long-term-support-linux-kernels-for-better-stability">3. Installing the LTS (long term support) Linux kernels for better stability&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Arch is famous for being really close to the current Linux kernels, which is good if you always want the newest packages and Linux features, but a bad idea if you are building a Deep Learning Workstation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is why I switched to the LTS kernels, which are basically kernels that receive more support and are more stable than the newer versions of the Linux Kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily switching kernels is super easy in Arch. First we will download the kernels, and afterward tell our boot manager which kernel to choose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First download the LTS kernels:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -S linux-lts linux-lts-headers&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Have a look at your current kernel versions:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ls -lsha /boot&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One kernel should be named vmlinuz-linux.img and initramfs-linux.img (your current versions) and the LTS ones the same with -lts at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are seeing two kernels you can now proceed to delete the old kernels:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -R linux&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now a more advanced part is that you will need to tell your bootloader which kernel to choose. The question is which bootloader you are using, but in most cases it is Grub. If you followed my Arch installation tutorial your bootloader is systemd-boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My recommendation is try the Grub instructions, and if that does not work proceed to the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="changing-the-grub-bootloader-for-the-lts-linux-kernels">Changing the Grub bootloader for the LTS linux kernels&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you see an error proceed to the next bootloader, otherwise reboot (sudo reboot).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="changing-the-syslinux-bootloader-for-the-lts-linux-kernels">Changing the syslinux bootloader for the LTS linux kernels&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Edit the config file:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo nano /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Simply add “-lts” to the vmlinuz-linux.img and initramfs-linux.img, such that they are vmlinuz-linux-lts.img and initramfs-linux-lts.img&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="changing-the-systemd-boot-bootloader-for-the-lts-linux-kernels">Changing the systemd-boot bootloader for the LTS linux kernels&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you are coming from my Arch installation guide, this is your bootloader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Edit the config file:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Simply add “-lts” to the vmlinuz-linux.img and initramfs-linux.img, such that they are vmlinuz-linux-lts.img and initramfs-linux-lts.img&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-installing-yay-an-easy-way-to-install-aur-packages">4. Installing yay, an easy way to install AUR packages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You should prefer to use the ultra-fast pacman to install most packages, but an amazing thing about Arch is that users create millions of custom packages that are super easy to install. You can basically find any program you can think of in this repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install git SVC&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -S git &lt;br>
mkdir ~/tmp &lt;br>
git clone &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git">https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git&lt;/a> ~/tmp/yay &lt;br>
cd ~/tmp/yay &lt;br>
makepkg -si&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now you can browse all the nice AUR packages in &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/&lt;/a> or just go for it and type:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>yay -S [PACKAGE]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To install it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="5-finally-the-real-cuda-cudnn-anaconda-installation-running-both-tensorflow-115-and-20">5. Finally, the real cuda, cudnn, anaconda installation running both TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Install Nvidia drivers, cuda, cudnn with a simple command&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils cuda cudnn&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This takes some time, so grab a coffee or proceed with the next steps&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download Anaconda, I like Miniconda:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>wget &lt;a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh">https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh&lt;/a> ~/&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Make it executable and install&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>cd ~/ &lt;br>
chmod +x ./Miniconda*.sh &lt;br>
./Miniconda*.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Just leave everything as default.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>source ./bash_profile&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Reboot your system&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sudo reboot&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Install tensorflow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now is the time to decide between TensorFlow for CPU or GPU. I will continue with the GPU option, but if you want to run the CPU version just remove the “-gpu” from the package name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="create-an-anaconda-environment-for-tensorflow-20">Create an anaconda environment for Tensorflow 2.0&lt;/h5>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>conda create &amp;ndash;name tf2.0 &lt;br>
conda activate tf2.0 &lt;br>
conda install pip &lt;br>
conda install tensorflow-gpu pandas numpy&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Done! Now check the result with:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>python &lt;br>
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib &lt;br>
device_lib.list_local_devices()&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If the result shows a device name like this you are done!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2018-05-01 05:25:25.929575: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1356] Found device 0 with properties:
name: GeForce GTX 3080 10GB major: …&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="create-an-anaconda-environment-for-tensorflow-115">Create an anaconda environment for Tensorflow 1.15&lt;/h5>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>conda deactivate &lt;br>
conda create &amp;ndash;name tf1.15 &lt;br>
conda activate tf1.15 &lt;br>
conda install pip python==3.7 &lt;br>
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.15&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And again check if everything works and your gpu is recognized:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>python &lt;br>
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib &lt;br>
device_lib.list_local_devices()&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="6-switching-between-tensorflow-115-and-tensorflow-20-on-one-device">6. Switching between TensorFlow 1.15 and TensorFlow 2.0 on one device!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Just a dream coming true in my opinion, just select the 1.15 version with&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>conda activate tf1.15&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the TensorFlow 2.0 version with&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>conda activate tf2.0&lt;/p>
