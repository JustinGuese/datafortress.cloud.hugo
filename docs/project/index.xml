&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of the project is to build a data landscape from existing and future data, which can then be used to better understand business processes and make automatic data-driven recommendations and decisions using machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A particular challenge was the handling of sensitive patient data, which is why the requirements of the German Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) and the Baden-Würtemberg Hospital IT Act had to be met.
Therefore, the first phase of the project consisted of planning and close coordination with several law firms to work out and plan the specifications of the hospital laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial architecture was serverless built on AWS, but was then redesigned to Kubernetes due to legal decisions regarding medical data. High data security was a requirement, as highly sensitive medical data is used and analyzed, which requires ISO certification and managing HL7 data.
I then deployed a BareMetal Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud with K3s, Terraform and MicroOS, which autoscales horizontally, load balances and automatically creates certificates (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)">https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)&lt;/a>. The cluster and deployment are continuously monitored and errors are automatically fixed. In addition to the security aspects, it further allows us to save 90% in costs compared to AWS EKS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the area of analytics, we created a dashboard for NoSQL and SQL data, as well as ETL pipelines to create a data warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Machine Learning, one goal was to run highly scalable models in the cloud to make decisions and classify customers and app users in Milliseconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to improve the customer journey, a &amp;ldquo;profile&amp;rdquo; was created for each custom, followed by manual analysis, classification using data science, and twin-customer analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>BMW plans to secure its local data in a hybrid cloud environment at 63 locations worldwide. For this purpose, HPE was engaged to work on a hybrid solution that uses their own on-site servers as well as the public cloud.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was hired by HPE for the BMW project to support HPE in the area of public cloud.
Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t give any details due to the NDA, but
HPE will use their own servers on site to cache a local copy of the data, but then using direct connections to the public cloud in reference to different storage classes, the data will be stored deduplicated in multiple public clouds. The whole system is continuously monitored and started using scheduling tools. A lot of custom Linux programming was required for this project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal was to process livestreams of tick stock market data in milliseconds and give decisions regarding trading strategies. In the further course, an automated trading bot was developed, which makes buying decisions based on machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In detail, ~120 tick data/seconds were processed, which were sent to Apache Kafka (meanwhile Flink) and then processed by autoscaling microservices (AWS Lambda). The model itself was hosted using OpenFAAS in a Docker Swarm cluster and performed purchase decisions via custom APIs to ASX.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of the project is to create a cloud architecture and software that collects information about potential customers and writes to them with a very personalized message on LinkedIn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this purpose, first a web scraper was set up, which searches LinkedIn, Twitter and Google for information about the potential contact, and interprets this information using NLP machine learning and creates a &amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; per customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A personalized cover letter is then generated using another NLP model, and another Selenium Python bot is used to send the message to the customer via LinkedIn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the software and models have to handle thousands of requests within a few Seconds, it was necessary to develop an autoscaling and fast architecture using Docker and AWS ECS, which at the same time does not incur too many costs due to GPU instances on AWS. The final architecture is a mix of Docker microservices and Spot instances that host the GPU Docker images on demand.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>AWS, MS Azure, ETL Pipelines, Tensorflow, Elasticsearch, SQL, NoSQL, Kafka, Python&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal was to combine various NoSQL and SQL databases in a central data warehouse and data lake.
Data had to be collected via batch jobs in a nightly process as well as &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; data via streaming using Kafka from different end devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A special requirement of the project was that large amounts of data had to be managed (20+ million web events / month, 2 TB/month), as well as the security standards had to be met by Volkswagen AG. Along with this, I was also massively involved in the implementation of the DSGVO standards, as well as with the group-wide &amp;ldquo;Team Cloud&amp;rdquo; from Volkswagen AG in the expansion of the cloud infrastructure with AWS and MS Azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various recommender systems were developed for use in apps and on websites, with the aim of displaying the perfect vehicle for a user. These were implemented in a simple way using graphs in Elasticsearch, and in more complex scenarios using precomputed clusters or machine learning models which were played out using OpenFAAS and Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, machine learning models were developed for the prediction of unit numbers, inventories and (vehicle) registration numbers.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal was to convert the existing Python/MariaDB/ML architecture into a serverless format and transfer it autoscaling and securely to AWS.
The existing architecture has not been secure, and did not scale. The individual components were isolated, packaged into Docker images, and deployed into private VPC&amp;rsquo;s using AWS ECS and API Gateway to ensure maximum security of the &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; models. The architecture was written in Terraform and is deployed using a Github Actions CI/CD pipeline. The architecture complies with the AWS &amp;ldquo;well-architected&amp;rdquo; specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unraceable is the name of a &lt;strong>virtual reality motionseat&lt;/strong> project and &lt;strong>App&lt;/strong> that I managed for three years.&lt;br>
The idea has been to enhance showrooms and build something that gives people an emotional experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The main campaign spot of “Audi #unraceable”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The requirement should be an improvement to the “Audi Sandbox”, which was produced by Audi Norway, as you can see in the following video.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge">THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first milestone of the product had a strict timeline and demanded that customers build their race-track in a sandbox, which gets scanned, and finally transferred to a virtual reality motion seat.&lt;br>
The “Audi Sandbox” had the problem, that it did not feature a motion seat and the “scanning” process has been mostly manual and took a lot of time. As the project should be presented at a fair, the scanning process could only take a maximum of some minutes, which means a new automated way to create this track had to be found.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strategy">THE STRATEGY&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the project, we worked together with a partner and experimented with several ways to make this idea become reality. For the scanning, an Xbox Kinect has been chosen, as it can both scan depth imagery (3D topography), as well as the color 2D image of the track. With this information, a map was generated in seconds (reducing complexity for time), and together with object scanning from the 2D image data objects could be placed on the 3D map as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fulfill the motion seat part, we scouted several solutions and finally decided to go with a 6 DOF motion simulator produced in the Czech republic. As it has not been equipped with Virtual Reality, the VR technology had to be fitted onto it.&lt;br>
This poses a huge problem, as traditional trackers are irritated by the motion seat-movement, as they can not distinguish if the head or the seat is moving. A customized solution was needed and involved fitting another tracker to the seat, and calculating the spacial difference of the seat, base stations and VR glasses in realtime. As VR glasses the HTC Vive has been chosen, as it offered the best resolution at that time. But a huge problem in VR is lag. If calculations of the scene take too long, and the image is slightly delayed to the movement of the motion seat, people feel motion-sick. This phenomenon is often called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness?oldformat=true">virtual reality sickness&lt;/a>” or “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness?oldformat=true">cybersickness&lt;/a>“. Therefore, the next steps involved trying several techniques to reduce motion sickness.&lt;br>
#unraceable has been featured in several magazines, and even appeared in “Austria’s Next Topmodel” as a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the final fair, #unraceable has been a great success and offered the production of several other milestones.&lt;br>
In the following year, it even appeared in a modified version at the worldwide “Formula E” traveling around the globe together with team “Audi Sport ABT”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/img_1286-768x576.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="milestone-2-unraceable-app-and-quattro-challenge">Milestone 2: #unraceable App and Quattro-Challenge&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The previous success allowed for further development of the project and an App should be produced to reach a broader mass. The idea has been, that four skiing stars (Quattro, like the “Audi Quattro”) should each build a track, which was then to be raced by gamers around the globe, with the final winner winning an Audi A1 for a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/9f01d087dae1e9abb8a2f8c125c7329a-768x555.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The track should be both playable on the simulator, as well as the app itself. Several changes were needed to achieve this, especially porting a high-quality VR game to a mobile game which only allows for limited resources. Several anti-cheat mechanisms had to be implemented, and new data privacy challenges had to be solved. In the end, the app had been downloaded more than 30’000 times reaching a review of 4,3/5 stars.&lt;br>
As a link to the car configurator of Audi had been integrated into the game, an enormous conversion rate has been achieved as almost 50% of gamers opened the car configurator at least once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://datafortress.cloud/images/img_3777-768x432.webp" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.audi.at/audi-erleben/unraceable">Link: Download the App&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="milestone-3-unraceable-ski-challenge">Milestone 3: #unraceable Ski-Challenge&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>The next step has been to cooperate with the Austrian Skiing Association (&lt;a href="https://www.oesv.at/" title="https://www.oesv.at/">https://www.oesv.at/&lt;/a>) and build something similar to the former “Skiing Challenge” that experienced great success in the past years. But the task has been to not simply emulate this success but to build something new. The idea was to drive up the skiing track (Hahnenkamm) with an Audi e-Tron (in similarity to the then Audi e-Tron spot where it drives up a skiing track like in the first “Quattro” spot) and then drive it down again using a skier. Again the app has been downloaded more than 30’000 times and is still being played today.&lt;/p>
