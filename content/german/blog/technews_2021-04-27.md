## 15 Menschen lebten 40 Tage in einer sonnenlosen HÃ¶hle ohne Uhren, um die Zeit zu studieren (4 Minuten Lesezeit)

https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7emd3/15-people-lived-=40-days-in-a-sunless-cave-without-clocks-to-study-time

15 people spent 40 days living in a cave in  France without sunlight, clocks, or contact with the outside world as part  of an experiment called Deep Time. Deep Time was designed to probe the hum an brain's conception of time and to study the group's response to life in  isolation. There were no natural cues to regulate circadian rhythms in the  darkness of the cave. Participants had to pass mental and physical examinat ions before the experiment, and they were monitored even after their exit.  The experiment could help scientists anticipate the challenges of long-term  submarine and space missions.
