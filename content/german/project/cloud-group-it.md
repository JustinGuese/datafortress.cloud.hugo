## THE STRATEGY

Furthermore, users had to be able to easily curate their content, which left us with the final choice of a modified WordPress installation as a final product. It has been a challenge to find the right balance between high-security, but usability as well. Of course, multiple complex login-scenarios, as well as advanced encryption, would be the go-to scenario, but it became clear that this greatly reduced usability. For the final version, we experimented with different security measures in a dialogue with the international teams to find the right balance.

Due to the international nature of the Enterprise, speed had been a requirement as well, in which we utilized AWS’s worldwide network to deliver content both real-time (streams, live streams, live-Q&A) as well as on-demand (videos, presentations, …).

The project received great support from the international teams and received further funding to enhance this solution.
