## [Facebook skirts Appleâ€™s App Store fees with custom subscription links for creators (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761620/facebook-apple-app-store-fees-subscription-links-creators?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4)

Facebook creators will soon be able to share custom web links to direct their fans to pay for subscriptions using Facebook's native payments system. The subscription feature is available in 27 countries to creators who meet certain eligibility requirements. Creators will receive all of the subscription money minus taxes if users sign up through the custom web link, as opposed to using Apple's in-app subscription. Apple takes a 30% cut of all in-app transactions processed through its system. Facebook is not charging creators for subscription transactions until at least 2023, and it will start paying creators a bonus of up to $20 for every new subscriber who signs up using their custom web link.

## ['Genetic Goldmine' in Earth's Harshest Desert Could Be The Key to Feeding The Future (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/genetic-goldmine-in-earth-s-harshest-desert-could-be-the-key-to-feeding-the-future)

An international team of researchers studied plant life in the Atacama desert for 10 years to identify genes that help give the plants an advantage in the desert. The Atacama desert is known for being the planet's driest non-polar desert. Identifying the mechanisms behind the plants' successes could reveal how to make food grow in a world affected by climate change. Some of the plants in the desert are closely related to staple crops, so scientists now have a better idea of how to engineer more resilient crops.

The bots can cost a few hundred a month to hire, with vendors boasting thousands of subscribers.
