## [The Brain Can Recall and Reawaken Past Immune Responses (6 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-science-shows-immune-memory-in-the-brain-20211108/)

Scientists from Israel have recently proved that mice brains can remember immune responses. The study involved giving mice a bout of colitis and then marking neurons active on the day the inflammation peaked. After the mice recovered, the scientists were able to trigger the immune response by stimulating the same neurons. Mice that had those neurons inhibited showed less severe disease symptoms. The study shows that the brain is inseparable from the immune system and this finding could have far-reaching implications.
