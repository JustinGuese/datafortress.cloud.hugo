## [TikTokâ€™s parent company acquires VR headset maker Pico (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648282/bytedance-tiktok-vr-pico-hardware?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4)

## [Luminate aims to make hair loss from chemotherapy a thing of the past (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/luminate-aims-to-make-hair-loss-from-chemotherapy-a-thing-of-the-past/)

Luminate Medical has created a medical wearable that prevents hair loss resulting from chemotherapy. The device is a sort of mechanized compression garment for the head. It restricts blood flow to the skin of the scalp during chemo sessions, allowing the drugs to flow where they are needed while saving the hair follicles from damage. Animal tests have resulted in hair retention of around 80 percent with no adverse side effects. It will still take some time for full human trials to be set up, but initial tests show that it works exactly as expected on people as well. Luminate plans to sell its treatment for $1,500.

Octopuses will deliberately throw things at other octopuses, a behavior that hints at advanced social dynamics among the creatures. New footage showing a female octopus throwing silt at a male 10 times in a row after he attempted to mate with her led scientists to conclude that the behavior was intentional. Octopuses have been observed punching fish out of spite, so this is not the first time octopuses have been found to be moody.
