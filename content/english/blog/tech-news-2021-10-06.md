## [How Quantum Computers Can Be Used to Build Better Quantum Computers (3 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2021/10/04/how-quantum-computers-can-be-used-to-build-better-quantum-computers/)

A team of Chinese researchers used a quantum computer to design a new type of qubit that significantly outperformed their previous designs. The new qubit design can hold its quantum state for longer and is less prone to errors. The researchers expect performance to increase even more as this was only a first prototype. By demonstrating that even basic quantum computers can help design future devices, the researchers have opened the door to significantly speedier innovation in the field.

## [Scientists Have Successfully Recorded Data to DNA in a Few Short Minutes (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/scientists-have-successfully-recorded-data-to-dna-in-a-few-short-minutes)

Scientists have utilized a novel enzymatic system to synthesize DNA into data in minutes rather than hours or days. The method synthesizes completely new DNA instead of copying a template. It uses an enzyme that can be directly manipulated. The method could be a potential solution to the explosive growth in data storage needs. It could also have applications in brain research.

## [Understanding How Facebook Disappeared from the Internet (6 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/)

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a mechanism for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems on the Internet. The Internet is a network of networks bound together by BGP. BGP allows one network to advertise its presence to all of the other networks that form the Internet. Facebook's recent outage was caused by a configuration change that caused its servers to stop announcing the routes to its DNS prefixes, making Facebook's DNS servers unavailable. More details about how the outage occurred are available in the article.
