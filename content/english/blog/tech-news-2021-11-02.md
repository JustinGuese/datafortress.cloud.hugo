## [Tesla is letting non-Tesla EVs use its Supercharger network for the first time (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757159/tesla-supercharge-ev-pilot-netherlands)

Ten Supercharger stations in the Netherlands are being made available to non-Tesla EVs. Elon Musk has long talked about opening up Tesla's vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. Other European countries will likely follow before Tesla opens up its Superchargers in the US as the company uses a proprietary connector in North America. Non-Tesla vehicles in North America will need an adapter to use Tesla's Superchargers.

## [The Simplest of Slumbers (13 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/if-alive-sleeps-brainless-creatures-shed-light-why-we-slumber/1/0100017ce01f4e38-70b79371-80cc-49cf-8e6b-0ff1533d77f1-000000/QKDja0usBm2XsRfT5I7m-kV4jbVrpqZqfD4TvUdpdnY=221)

This article describes several sleep studies in animals to explore the nature of sleep. There is a lot of variation in how different animals sleep. Animals with brains consolidate memories, flush out toxic waste, and strengthen connections between nerve cells during sleep. Animals without brains seem to also need sleep, suggesting that sleep plays a deeper role in preserving basic physiological processes. The study of sleep in brainless creatures is controversial, but new data shows that even the earliest lifeforms show signs of sleep.

## [Researchers boost human mental function with brain stimulation (3 minute read)](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-boost-human-mental-function-brain.html)

A team of scientists created a system that targets a brain region with small amounts of electrical energy to improve mental function. It is the first time that scientists have been able to reliably enhance a specific human mental function linked to mental illness. The system could provide a new approach to treating mental illness, where instead of suppressing symptoms, patients can use tools to take control of their own minds. Clinical trials are set to begin soon.

## [MangoDB (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/MangoDB-io/MangoDB)

MangoDB is a proxy that converts MongoDB wire protocol queries to SQL and uses PostgreSQL as a database engine. It is an open-source alternative to MongoDB as MongoDB has changed its license to make it unusable for many open source and commercial projects. MangoDB will be compatible with MongoDB drivers and will work as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB in many cases. It is still in a very early stage of development.
