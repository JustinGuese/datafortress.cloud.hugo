## [CPU algorithm trains deep neural nets up to 15 times faster than top GPU trainers (2 minute read)](https://techxplore.com/news/2021-04-rice-intel-optimize-ai-commodity.html)

Computer scientists from Rice University have created an artificial intelligence software that can train deep neural networks 15 times faster on commodity processors than software that relies on graphic processors. The team built its system by recasting deep neural network training as a search problem that could be solved with hash tables. Companies can spend millions of dollars a week just to train and fine-tune their AI workloads, so the benefits of making commodity CPUs more efficient than specialized hardware cannot be understated.

## [Infrared Radiation From Our Hands Could Be the Future of Encryption (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/infrared-radiation-from-our-hands-could-be-the-future-of-encryption)

Chinese engineers have developed a method for using the infrared radiation emitted from the human hand to secure data. The human hand radiates infrared light, and each finger can serve as an independent infrared light source. As fingerprints are unique, they can be used as a non-copyable encryption key. Using human components as IR light sources could provide more flexibility in the way we control engineered systems.

The value of a punk is determined by the users in the CryptoPunks Discord community. Due to the rarity of CryptoPunks, using one as an avatar on social media sites has become a sort of 'digital flex' for some.
