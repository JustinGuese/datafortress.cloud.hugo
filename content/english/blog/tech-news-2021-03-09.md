SpaceX is seeking regulatory approval to connect its Starlink network to cars, trucks, shipping boats, and aircraft.

## [The US Army's New Goggles Let Troops See Through Solid Walls (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/us-army-goggles-troops-see-through-solid-walls)

The US army is developing Integrated Augmented Vision System (IAVS) goggles for infantry forces. The goggles will enable soldiers to check around corners, see in the dark, and see maps and other data on the goggles' lenses. Soldiers inside armored vehicles will be able to see through the walls of the vehicle using feeds from the cameras outside. The IAVS goggles are designed to perform like the heads-up displays used in fighter jets.

## [Hereâ€™s a Slug That Can Sever Its Own Head and Grow a New Body (4 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzjxj/heres-a-slug-that-can-sever-its-own-head-and-grow-a-new-body)

Scientists from Japan have found a species of slug that can self-decapitate and regrow their bodies from their heads. It appears that the slug does this in response to parasites in its body. The slugs survive without their organs as the algae they eat can temporarily power their heads with photosynthesis. The bodies do not grow back the heads, but they still react to tactile prompts and sometimes live for months after the decapitation. Images of the slugs are available in the article.

## [The pirate assembling a better sports streaming service (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/22303642/hehestreams-pirate-sports-streaming-service-nba-nfl-mlb-nhl)

HeheStreams is a service that streams live broadcasts of every NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLB game on TV. It costs $100 a year, half of what the NBA charges for its League Pass, but without the bureaucracy and obligations to cable powerbrokers. The service is breaking all sorts of copyright laws. Local blackout restrictions and television contracts mean that consumers can't always access the content they want, which is why they turn to using alternative services.
