## [15 People Lived 40 Days in a Sunless Cave Without Clocks to Study Time (4 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7emd3/15-people-lived-40-days-in-a-sunless-cave-without-clocks-to-study-time)

15 people spent 40 days living in a cave in France without sunlight, clocks, or contact with the outside world as part of an experiment called Deep Time. Deep Time was designed to probe the human brain's conception of time and to study the group's response to life in isolation. There were no natural cues to regulate circadian rhythms in the darkness of the cave. Participants had to pass mental and physical examinations before the experiment, and they were monitored even after their exit. The experiment could help scientists anticipate the challenges of long-term submarine and space missions.

## [Archaeologists May Have Found The World’s Oldest Home (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/archaeologists-may-have-found-the-worlds-oldest-home)

The oldest home in hominin history is the Wonderwerk Cave located in South Africa. The cave shows evidence of continuous occupation over several million years, with signs of the use of fire and precious artifacts found at the site. Its inhabitants were not fully human, and it may have been inhabited by more than one early human ancestor species. The cave was clearly a valued site in the past, and it is still a sacred place for locals today.
