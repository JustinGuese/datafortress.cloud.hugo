## [South African scientists copy Modernaâ€™s COVID vaccine (6 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00293-2)

Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, a biotechnology company in South Africa, have recreated very small amounts of Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine against Covid-19 without any involvement by Moderna. The company developed the vaccine as part of an initiative launched by the World Health Organization to build capacity for vaccine manufacturing in low- and middle-income countries. mRNA vaccine developers have sent more than 70% of their doses to wealthy nations. Millions of orders to poorer countries have been delayed. While Afrigen's vaccine won't help curb the pandemic this year, it will lay the foundation for a more globally distributed mRNA vaccine industry in the future.

## [Physicists just made a breakthrough: quantum states that last over 5 seconds (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/quatum-state-over-5-seconds)

A team of researchers from the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago managed to maintain a quantum state for more than five seconds, a new record. They used a method called 'single shot readout', which uses precise laser pulses to add single electrons to qubits to extend their quantum states for longer. The system they developed is theoretically able to perform over 100 million quantum operations in the five seconds. Five seconds is long enough for light to travel around the world almost 40 times, so the advance brings the possibility of a distributed quantum internet closer to reality.

## [Yes, I can connect to a DB in CSS (7 minute read)](https://bit.ly/3301Vze/1/0100017ec46d57bc-bc2e1a13-3043-49f4-af44-b5c8e6e2c83e-000000/YPlObx1JeBVJKW75_gzXKAGyggcMDCkH_fGJ53skQVg=235)

A recent viral tweet making a joke about recruiters with unreasonable expectations inspired a developer to write CSS code that connects to a database. This article details how the developer built the app with code and examples. The project only works in Chrome, but it will work with any SQLite database provided.

## [Raspberry Pi OS now available in 64-bit, improving app compatibility (2 minute read)](https://www.xda-developers.com/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit/)

Raspberry Pi has released a 64-bit version of its default operating system. Raspberry Pi OS is a Debian-based Linux desktop built specifically for the Pi family. Adding a 64-bit version of the operating system will help increase compatibility with many applications. It also means more applications and services can access the higher amounts of RAM on higher-tier Raspberry Pi boards. The new OS is only compatible with the Pi Zero 2, Pi 3, and Pi 4.
