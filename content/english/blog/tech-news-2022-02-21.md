## [Why Nasa is exploring the deepest oceans on Earth (11 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220111-why-nasa-is-exploring-the-deepest-oceans-on-earth)

Over 80% of the ocean is unexplored. Humans know more about the surface of Mars and the Moon than about the ocean floor. NASA is planning a mission to explore the deep ocean that will push the limits of science and technology in one of the most extreme environments on the planet. The oceans are surprisingly similar to conditions NASA expects to find on other worlds. Organisms are known to thrive in the oppressive environment at the bottom of the ocean. Studying the ocean floor could give scientists clues on what to look for when searching for life on other planets.

## [The Fastest GIF Does Not Exist (8 minute read)](https://www.biphelps.com/blog/The-Fastest-GIF-Does-Not-Exist)

To make the fastest possible GIFs, set the frame delay to 20ms instead of 10ms. Browsers do not support 0 delay with GIFs, and anything with a delay and less than 20ms is pushed to 100ms. 20ms is the sweet spot where the framerate ends up being the fastest. Examples are available in the article.
