## [Scientists Have Grown Acid-Producing Advanced Mini-Stomachs In the Lab (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/scientists-have-grown-acid-producing-advanced-mini-stomachs-in-the-lab)

Scientists from the Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center have created mini-stomachs from human pluripotent stem cells that can contract and produce acid. The scientists turned stem cells into three primary germ layers and used them to generate stomach tissue with abilities close to regular stomachs. The mini-stomachs were transplanted into mice, where they grew a thousand times larger than they usually would in a cell culture and also developed features that had been lacking. The team aims to be able to transplant organoid tissues into human patients by the end of the decade.

## [Self-Driving Microscopes to Navigate the Nanoscale (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/confocal-microscopy)

The cutting edge of microscopy is as much art as it is science, with human operators having to make educated guesses about what features they are hoping to analyze. There is still no way to predict functionality from structure. Deep learning could help the field immensely. The technology could help scientists easily identify structures and automate processes, leading to the possibility of developing manufacturing capabilities. Autonomous microscopy will enable more opportunities for scientific discovery, but it will likely be a difficult process.
