The technology has gone through several form factors, with some versions covering the entire side of the ear.

## [Bionaut Labs launches with plans to attack brain tumors with tiny, guided robots (4 minute read)](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bionaut-labs-launches-plans-to-attack-brain-tumors-tiny-guided-robots)

Bionaut Labs has unveiled tiny remote-controlled devices designed to travel through the human body to deliver medicine where it is needed the most. The robots are smaller than a millimeter and have few moving parts. They can navigate through tissues and go where surgeons cannot. The Bionauts work like miniature screws, pushing their way through the body while being guided by magnetic fields generated outside the body. Once they are in the body, the Bionauts can't turn. So far, they have shown great promise as a new targeted treatment modality for severe brain disorders.

## [Troll Research Station: how to operate an airport in Antarctica (5 minute read)](https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/troll-research-station-how-to-operate-an-airport-in-antarctica/)

In 2005, the Troll Research Station in Antarctica opened a 3000-meter blue ice runway, allowing people to get to the station without weeks of travel. Construction of the runway took two years. A laser cutter was used to level the blue ice near the station. Preparing the runway for flights is a two-week process. The runway moves a few meters each year as it sits on a glacier. Fuel is sent to Troll once a year. Pictures of the airfield are available in the article.

## [I have one of the most advanced prosthetic arms in the world — and I hate it (15 minute read)](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/cyborg-chic-bionic-prosthetic-arm-sucks)

Some users of high-end prosthetics find the devices much less useful than the media coverage around the technology would have you think. A majority of upper-limb prostheses users report very negative experiences, with rejection rates as high as 44 percent. The devices are usually heavy and difficult to control. They are also expensive, and most insurance policies will not cover them. Becoming a cyborg is not accessible by many, but right now, it isn't a practical option anyway.
