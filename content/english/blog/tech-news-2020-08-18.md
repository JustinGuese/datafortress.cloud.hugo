## [Rocket Lab aims to launch private Venus mission in 2023 (3 minute read)](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html/1/01000174010c5bd1-1874648f-1838-45dc-80bd-194574022378-000000/SEqmrrrroptJOyaMeyC8uB6upA5WmVja8La_51BZr3c=154)

Rocket Lab, a Californian-based spaceflight company, is planning a robotic astrobiology mission to Venus in 2023. Venus used to be a planet with oceans, lakes, and rivers, before the planet became hot and dry. Scientists believe that there could be life in the planet's atmosphere, where potentially habitable pockets have temperatures and pressures similar to the Earth's surface environment. The Venus mission will involve deploying probes into the planet's atmosphere using Rocket Lab's Photon satellite platform. When Photon becomes available for customers, it will significantly lower the cost of doing science in space.
