Scientists have recorded the activity of a dying human brain for the first time. A patient was being monitored with an EEG for seizures when they had a heart attack and died.

## [Inside “Project Tinman”: Peloton’s plan to conceal rust in its exercise bikes (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/inside-project-tinman-pelotons-plan-to-conceal-rust-in-its-exercise-bikes/)

Staff at Peloton warehouses noticed that rust was building up on some exercise machines in September last year.

Rust is not covered under Peloton's warranty, so customers were denied replacements when they complained. Peloton has since stated that they will replace rusted machines.

## [Internet guerrillas: Inside the DIY broadband revolution with NYC Mesh (6 minute read)](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nyc-mesh-guerrilla-internet-network/)

NYC Mesh is a group run entirely by volunteers to provide affordable and reliable internet to residents in New York City. Customers can pay whatever they like for the service, but NYC Mesh recommends a monthly $20 to $60 donation. The group hopes that their work inspires other groups around the world to stand up to monopolistic ISPs. There has been some pushback from regulators against mesh wireless technology. The tech requires access to high points and locations, so establishing a community-run mesh network in flatter areas would be difficult.
