## [New study finds 20% of people have a genetic mutation that provides resilience to the cold (3 minute read)](https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-finds-20-of-people-have-a-genetic-mutation-that-provides-resilience-to-the-cold/)

One in five people lacks a protein in their fast-twitch muscle fibers, which results in those individuals having better resilience to the cold. Those who lack the protein are better at keeping warm and at enduring a tougher climate. When warming up after cold-water immersion, people who lack the protein increase the activation of slow-twitch fibers rather than fast-twitch fibers. People who lack the protein rarely succeed in sports that require strength and explosiveness, but they tend to have a greater capacity for endurance sports.

## [This is what happens when bitcoin miners take over your town (31 minute read)](https://www.politico.eu/article/this-is-what-happens-when-bitcoin-miners-take-over-your-town/)

Bitcoin mining uses a huge amount of electricity. A mining setup requires a building, hundreds of high-speed computer servers, a heavy-duty cooling system, and a location that can handle a lot of electricity. Back in 2013, many bitcoin miners were attracted to the area around the Columbia River due to the cheap power from the five hydroelectric dams along the river. Many properties in the area were converted to cryptocurrency mines. Other regions in the world with cheap electricity have also seen a rise in mining hubs. Bitcoin's popularity has now increased to the point where it is no longer feasible for smaller operators to continue mining.
