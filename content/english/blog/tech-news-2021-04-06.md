## [Yahoo Answers will be shut down forever on May 4th (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368488/yahoo-answers-shutdown-may-4-internet-era-over-rip)

Yahoo Answers will shut down on May 4. After that day, the website will start redirecting to the Yahoo homepage and all of the platform's archives will cease to exist. New submissions will no longer be accepted on the site after April 20. Users will have until June 30 to request their data before it becomes inaccessible. The service has become less popular over the years, so the company has decided to shift its resources away to focus on other products.

## [Tim Cook says Apple wants to use AR to make conversations better (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview)

Tim Cook offered some hints about Apple's thinking on augmented reality and cars in a recent interview with The New York Times. Augmented reality is critically important to Apple's future. It could be used to enhance conversations with imagery in many fields, such as health, education, retail, and gaming.

## [Decellularized Spinach Serves as an Edible Platform for Growing Artificial Meat (3 minute read)](https://scitechdaily.com/decellularized-spinach-serves-as-an-edible-platform-for-growing-artificial-meat/)

The veiny skeleton of a spinach leaf can support the growth of artificial meat. Spinach provides a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly scaffold that may accelerate the development of cultured meat. Previous studies have demonstrated that spinach leaf scaffolds can be used for cultivating human heart tissue. Researchers will now focus on growing more cells on the leaves to create thicker steaks and to investigate other animal and plant cell alternatives.

## [Israeli Startup Nanox Gets FDA Approval for Digital X-ray System (2 minute read)](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-israeli-startup-nanox-gets-fda-approval-for-digital-x-ray-system-1.9681718)

An Israeli startup, Nanox, has developed a new type of X-ray machine that generates 3D images. It emits less radiation and costs a fraction of the price of conventional imaging devices. The Nanox.ARC uses a proprietary silicon chip embedded with 100 million nanocones that generate X-rays. The FDA has granted clearance for the single-source Nanox.ARC, and Nanox expects to get the same approval for its multisource Nanox.ARC and the Nanox.CLOUD. Nanox plans to deploy the multisource Nanox.ARC across the globe. The device will expand access to imaging services to the roughly two-thirds of the world's population who currently have limited or no meaningful access to imaging.

The Voyager Class Space Station is scheduled to open in 2027. It will accommodate up to 280 guests at once, entertaining them with several bars and restaurants, a cinema, a gym, and a spa. Construction will begin in 2026. Guests can already make bookings at the space hotel. A three-and-a-half-day stay will cost $5 million, including travel to get there and back. Guests will have to go through training before their stay.
