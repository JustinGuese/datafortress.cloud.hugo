## [Innovative capsule allows mRNA vaccines to be delivered orally (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/capsule-oral-mrna-vaccine-mit/)

Scientists from MIT have demonstrated a technique that can deliver mRNA therapies directly to the digestive tract using a capsule. The technique uses capsules coated with microneedles that inject their contents directly into the wall of the gut. It was first used to deliver insulin into pigs, but new studies have demonstrated that it is also effective for mRNA delivery. More work is still needed to determine whether mRNA vaccines administered in this way can lead to systemic immune responses.

## [Reimagining Chess with AlphaZero (17 minute read)](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/2/258230-reimagining-chess-with-alphazero/fulltext)

It learns its strategies from scratch by playing games with itself, resulting in a unique approach to playing chess. This article discusses an experiment where AlphaZero played chess with different rule variants to see how chess would have looked like if history had taken a slightly different course. The results of the experiment show how some variants of chess can still lead to games that are at least as engaging as classical chess.
