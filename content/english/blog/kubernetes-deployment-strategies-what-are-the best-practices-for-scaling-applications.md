# Kubernetes deployment strategies: What are the best practices for scaling applications?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that provides powerful and efficient mechanisms for deploying, managing, and scaling applications in the cloud. As such, it's no surprise that Kubernetes has become one of the most popular solutions for companies looking to make their existing infrastructure both more robust and scalable. In this blog post, we'll look at some ofthe best practices when it comes to deploying applications using a Kubernetes system, examining strategies from defining deployable resources to controlling access control. Read on to get started learning about how your company can leverage this versatile technology!

## What is Kubernetes and what are its benefits for scaling applications

Kubernetes is an open-source system used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It's offered by many cloud providers and its use is growing across industries. Kubernetes alleviates the pain associated with scaling applications at a large scale in a simple and efficient manner. Now businesses no longer have to worry about manually handling any extra capacity or wasting time managing automatic deployments. Kubernetes simplifies previously complex tasks like rolling updates, cluster scheduling, service discovery, application failover, and scalability by providing an automatable infrastructure layer. With its flexibility and ability to cope with quick changes in demand, it has proven itself totally invaluable for applications today.

## The three most popular Kubernetes deployment strategies 

Deploying applications to Kubernetes is an enticing proposition for many tech-savvy enterprises, as the platform can help make application management more efficient. With that said, it’s important to understand the best practices for deploying your cloud native software correctly. After all, a good deployment strategy can save your organization from potential security threats and costly downtime. Three of the most popular strategies for deploying applications on Kubernetes are direct deployment, auto-deployment, and rolling deployment. Each one offers different advantages and disadvantages that must be weighed before opting for that particular approach. As always, carefully evaluating these strategies according to your organization’s risks and needs will be critical if you want a successful application running on Kubernetes.

## Comparing and contrasting the three strategies

Docker and Kubernetes are powerful tools for deploying applications in the cloud. However, when it comes to selecting the best deployment strategy for an application, there are three distinct strategies to choose from: rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases. Rolling updates allow you to slowly introduce changes in your application by gradually replacing old nodes with new ones. On the other hand, blue-green deployments use two distinct sets of servers running different versions of the service in order to reduce downtime and increase reliability. Lastly, canary releases provide a way to deploy a new version of your code to a subset of users so that you can monitor their behavior before fully releasing the new version. You can make use of these strategies individually or mix them together depending on the nature and complexity of your project. Thus, understanding their features and implementation differences helps you to select an appropriate strategy for your deployment needs.

## The best practices for scaling applications with Kubernetes

Scaling applications with Kubernetes has become commonplace, due in part to the execution of the best practices involved. Rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases are key tactics that can be utilized to optimize your scaling efforts for any application running on Kubernetes. With rolling updates, you can incrementally deploy software across a cluster with no service interruption and test out upgrades/downgrades without incident. Blue-green deployments offer zero downtime as well, by having a production version (blue) and a testing version (green); features or bug fixes can be tested out on the green version before making them available in the production environment. Finally, Canary releases enable application developers to deploy versions of microservices directly to end users in a controlled manner in order to gather feedback before fully releasing it. Utilizing these best practices will ensure your scaling success when deploying applications with Kubernetes!
