## [Researchers ready world-first vision restoration device for human clinical trials (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/researchers-ready-world-first-vision-restoration-device-for-human-clinical-trials//1/0100017496629a53-365be9ee-6e79-4319-af21-d1b7437c84c9-000000/wgA3Cju9xs6oyMGDcfxyF_QQYMlEXg0vcBicWA126dM=158)

Scientists at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia have produced a device that can restore vision to the blind using a combination of smartphone-style electronics and brain-implanted microelectrodes. The researchers are now preparing for the first human clinical trials to take place after successful preclinical studies and trials on sheep. There are still many steps required before the device will be available for commercial use. The technology works by transmitting converted image data from a camera to neurons via microelectrodes that are thinner than a human hair.

## [Animals' Magnetic Navigation 'Sixth Sense' Might Come From Bacteria (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/animals-magnetic-navigation-sixth-sense-might-come-from-bacteria/1/0100017496629a53-365be9ee-6e79-4319-af21-d1b7437c84c9-000000/QwXu1ADmB23-BMoFPL_aqUgv52VSkjMANrkLYTEO9JI=158)

Some animals, such as sea turtles, birds, fish, and lobsters, can sense the Earth's magnetic field and use this ability as an impressive navigation tool. After 50 years of research, scientists have proposed that the mechanism works through a symbiotic relationship between the animals and magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria are a special type of bacteria whose movement is influenced by magnetic fields. The researchers searched for the presence of magnetotactic bacteria DNA in animal samples and found that many animals carry the bacteria. It is still unknown where these bacteria live inside the animals, but it is likely they are associated with nervous tissue.

## [Chinese database details 2.4 million influential people, their kids, addresses, and how to press their buttons (6 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/15/china_shenzhen_zhenhua_database//1/0100017496629a53-365be9ee-6e79-4319-af21-d1b7437c84c9-000000/S9Y6uBsh4kaydzq5172YLyd0zTy1qvP7029N18QiaCc=158)

A US academic has uncovered a database used by Shenzhen Zhenhua, a Chinese company known to work with intelligence, military, and security agencies. The database contains information that could be used to conduct influence operations against prominent and influential people outside China. It contains information on influential individuals and institutions across a variety of industries. The data allows Chinese analysts to track key influencers and how news and opinions move through social media platforms. Using the information, China can craft messages to target individuals to manipulate them.
