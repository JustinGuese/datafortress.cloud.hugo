## [Latest success from Googleâ€™s AI group: Controlling a fusion reactor (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/latest-success-from-googles-ai-group-controlling-a-fusion-reactor/)

Google's DeepMind AI team has successfully trained its software to control a tokamak. Small reactors like tokamaks use software to monitor the state of the plasma they contain and respond to any changes. Control software tends to be fairly specialized. A rewrite is usually required if scientists want to experiment with different plasma configurations. DeepMind's software can produce different plasma configurations in real hardware. The model could be used to find ways to optimize existing hardware.

## [Scientists create universal blood-type organs for transplant (9 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/universal-blood-type-organs)

The wait for a heart or lung transplant takes an average of four months. Kidneys can take up to five years. Blood types can affect whether organs are accepted by a body's immune system. This can cause some patients to miss out on transplants if they have the wrong blood type.
