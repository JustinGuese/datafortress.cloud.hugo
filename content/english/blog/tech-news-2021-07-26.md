## [Acoustic Tweezers Can Pick Objects Up With Sound Waves â€“ Without Any Physical Contact (3 minute read)](https://scitechdaily.com/acoustic-tweezers-can-pick-objects-up-with-sound-waves-without-any-physical-contact/)

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a technology that uses sound waves to pick up objects. Scientists have been using light to move microscopic objects around for many years using a technique called optical trapping. Acoustic trapping can manipulate larger, millimeter-sized objects. The new technique achieves more accuracy and control over previous attempts. An 11-second video demonstrating the acoustic trapping technique is available in the article.
