When the project started, the city had 220 farms, meeting 14 percent of its demand for leafy vegetables, 26 percent for eggs, and 10 percent for fish. 30 by 30 is increasing its demand for tech-based solutions due to the limited land in Singapore.

Coelacanths were thought to be extinct until one was found off the coast of South Africa in 1938. They are found in undersea canyons at depths of 330 to 1640 miles. Nets used to catch sharks can be set in deep water and are now the biggest threat to the survival of coelacanths in Madagascar. There has been a rise in accidental coelacanth captures, with a large percentage of pregnant females, who only produce 140 live babies throughout their lives. Banning the nets is not possible right now.
