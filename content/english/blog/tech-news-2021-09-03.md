## [Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page)

Apple has changed its App Store rules to allow developers of reader apps to share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their accounts. Reader apps are apps that allow users to access previously purchased content, but do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase.

The change was made to close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission into a suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act.

## [A New Navy Weapon Actually Stops You From Talking (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/a-new-navy-weapon-actually-stops-you-from-talking)

Acoustic Hailing and Disruption (AHAD) is a weapon invented by the US Navy designed to stop people from talking. It records speech and instantly broadcasts it at a target, disrupting a target's concentration and discouraging them from continuing to speak. The broadcasted sound is in a narrow beam and directed so only the speaker can hear it. It makes a noticeable change in behavior in the target and will likely be confusing to anyone listening to the target person. The system can also project sound onto surfaces so that audio appears to come from the target.
