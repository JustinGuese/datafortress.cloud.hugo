## [MIT Researchers Figured Out How To Make Batteries That Are a Kilometer Long (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/mit-researchers-figured-out-how-to-make-batteries-that-are-a-kilometer-long)

Researchers at MIT have created a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in the form of a 460-foot-long fiber. The batteries can be manufactured to arbitrarily long lengths. They can be 3D-printed into any shape, opening up possibilities for wearable electronics and devices with batteries that double as structural parts. An image of a fiber battery wrapped around a toy submarine is available in the article.

## [China is Home to World's First Small Modular Nuclear Reactor (3 minute read)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-home-worlds-first-small-041435116.html)

China Huaneng Group Co.â€™s 200-megawatt small modular reactor at Shidao Bay is now operational. The nuclear plant will go into full commercial operations next year after connecting a second reactor. Its reactors are designed to shut down passively if anything goes wrong. China is expected to invest up to $440 billion into nuclear power over the next decade and a half. Small module reactors are less costly to build and operate, faster to implement, and have shorter shutdown times compared to traditional nuclear plants, making them an exciting technology for nuclear experts.

## [Detailed Footage Finally Reveals What Triggers Lightning (6 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/radio-telescope-reveals-how-lightning-begins-20211220/)

A network of radio telescopes in the Netherlands made detailed recordings of a lightning bolt during a summer storm in 2018. The recordings, which were processed only recently, show lightning starting up inside a thundercloud. They were used to create a 3D image of the lightning. The pattern of pulses recorded indicates that lightning starts with clusters of ice inside of a cloud. An animation of the lightning flash is available in the article.
