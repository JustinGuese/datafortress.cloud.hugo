## [Scientists accidentally discover life 900m under Antarctic ice (3 minute read)](https://www.euronews.com/living/2021/02/15/scientists-accidentally-discover-life-900m-under-antarctic-ice)

Researchers have found sea sponges and several potentially undiscovered species living 900 meters below an Antarctic ice shelf. The creatures were living in complete darkness in temperatures of -2.2 degrees Celsius. They were found by geologists as they were drilling for sediment samples. The drilling site was 260 km away from open water, so it is a mystery where the creatures were obtaining food for survival.

## [Clean-Energy, No-Cost Skylight Makes Seawater Drinkable (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/clean-no-cost-skylight-makes-drinkable-seawater)

The Solar Desalination Skylight stores the sun's energy during the day to light homes at night. It also distills seawater into drinking water, allowing the owners of the skylight to use a tap at the base to pour water. The leftover brine from the process is used to generate an electrical charge to power a diffused light. The design is cheap and solves two key issues faced by the inhabitants of shantytowns. It is one of six finalists of the Lexus Design Award 2021.

## [Pigs Can Game, Scientists Discover (5 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g4d5/pigs-can-game-scientists-discover)

Scientists have confirmed that pigs can game. Four pigs showed a remarkable ability to play a joystick-operated video game originally developed by NASA to test monkeys. The pigs were trained on how to use a joystick and then they gamed once a day for 12 weeks. They had to stop the study as some of the pigs had grown too large to stand long enough to complete the sessions. Each pig had its own individual aptitude for the tasks. Positive encouragement from their caretakers resulted in better outcomes in the game. A picture of a pig on one of the gaming consoles is available in the article.
