## [Samsung’s new TV remote uses radio waves from your router to stay charged (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860390/samsung-eco-remote-2022-solar-rf-harvesting-charging/1/0100017e24c838e6-51710beb-88cf-4661-bca5-acaf0c19e568-000000/gy-SDd7huTalx85treIO2VejMSj6nRQt0jdyACZWWDs=230)

Samsung's new Eco Remote can harvest RF waves and convert them into energy. It can also be charged from both indoor and outdoor light, as well as over USB-C. A white model will be introduced this year. Samsung estimates that switching to solar-powered remotes could prevent 99 million batteries from being discarded over the course of seven years.

## [China’s ‘artificial sun’ is five-times hotter than the real thing (2 minute read)](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/china-artificial-sun-nuclear-fusion-renewable-b1985795.html)

The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) fusion reactor in China reached temperatures of 70 million degrees Celsius, five times hotter than the Sun, for more than 17 minutes during a recent experiment. EAST aims to deliver near-limitless clean energy by mimicking the natural reactions occurring within stars. The project has already cost China more than £700 billion. The EAST team will provide technical support for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) currently being constructed in France. ITER will be the world's largest reactor once completed.

## [Dementia-preventing nasal spray moves to human trials (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/dementia-nasal-spray-rifampicin-resveratrol-human-trials/)

A novel nasal spray designed to prevent the neurodegeneration associated with dementia has shown promising results in mouse studies. The spray is a combination of two pre-existing drugs. Mice with neurodegenerative diseases showed improved cognition and less accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain after the spray was intranasally administered five times a week for a month. The combination of drugs was more effective at preventing neurodegeneration than each drug by itself. Human trials will start soon in several countries, including Japan and the US.
