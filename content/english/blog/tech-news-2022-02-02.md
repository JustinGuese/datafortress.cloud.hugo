Experimentation on human embryos is forbidden under international law, but the scientists claim that the system would be safer than natural childbearing.

## [Fetch API has landed into Node.js (Hacker News thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30161626/1/0100017eba20b50b-4ef1e90c-e9b8-407e-a7ff-c6856dbc1f50-000000/UWPjIB0Z61IxXX2nKYY8cfvhHEYQ6XAw23bUOVb9tHM=235)

## [Tesla recalls over 54,000 models over FSD update that disobeys stop signs (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-recalls-over-54000-models-over-fsd-update-that-disobeys-stop-signs/)

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has issued a recall of 53,822 Tesla vehicles due to the Assertive mode on the company's Full Self-Driving software. Cars set on Assertive mode may perform rolling stops at all-way-stop intersections under certain conditions. It is unclear how often this occurs and there are no known crashes, injuries, or fatalities related to the issue. The rolling-stop functionality can be disabled through an over-the-air update, so Tesla owners likely won't need to go to any service centers.
