Loon has launched its first commercial service in Kenya. Alphabet's fleet of around 35 floating balloons will provide 4G LTE service to Telkom Kenya subscribers within a 50,000 square kilometer region across western and central areas of the country. Loon has been testing its balloons in Kenya for several months now, connecting 35,000 unique users to the internet. The balloons fly at roughly 20 km above the ground, analyzing the weather to ride around on stratospheric winds. They stay in the air for over 100 days before returning to earth. The balloons were designed to supplement existing connectivity options rather than to replace them.

## [Pink Snow in the Italian Alps Is a Cute Sign of Environmental Catastrophe (3 minute read)](https://earther.gizmodo.com/pink-snow-in-the-italian-alps-is-a-cute-sign-of-environ-1844279404/1/010001732debe5d6-0d5ca683-97dc-4318-a9b1-c296dbbcd96c-000000/8SzvbESx9YHag9uf9XsgGRv9YWxWlzwVb2d8OOlC5RI=148)

While pink glacial ice might be pretty, it is a more sinister sign than it looks. The pink color in pink snow is caused by algae. Pink snow usually occurs in spring or summer, when there is enough light and warmth for the algae to grow. Whiter snow is better at reflecting light and thus keeping itself cool. Pink snow absorbs more light, which causes a chain reaction that causes more ice to melt. Many areas around the world saw pink snow blooms this year.
