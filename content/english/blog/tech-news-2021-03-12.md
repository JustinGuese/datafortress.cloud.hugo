## [HeadFi system gives dumb headphones smart functions (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/wearables/headfi-dumb-headphones-smart-functions/)

HeadFi is a system that features an adapter module that any set of headphones can plug into.

## [The World's First Programmable Organism (12 minute read)](https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/xenobots-claire-evans/)

Xenobots are living robots that can be programmed. Their bodies are designed by an evolutionary computer algorithm. Xenobots are made up of living embryonic frog cells, which are carefully placed into molds designed by the algorithm. These simple organisms have no brains and their behaviors are determined by the shape of their bodies. The creatures show proto-cognitive capacities, preferences, capabilities, and IQ. This creates an ethical dilemma, as scientists don't know when a cluster of cells becomes a living creature.
