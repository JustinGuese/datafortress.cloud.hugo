## [Snapchatâ€™s new AR features can identify the world around you (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search)

Scan is a new feature from Snapchat that can identify a range of objects. It can suggest AR effects and songs based on what the camera is looking at, recommend shops based on clothing, and more. The features are powered by other companies, so more functionality is expected soon. Scan will not be limited to just the Snapchat camera. Snap's AR glasses have a dedicated Scan button that triggers AR effects based on what the wearer is viewing. The new Spectacles aren't available for sale, but Snap has been giving them to select AR creators and partners.

## [Graphene veils may hold the secret to conserving priceless works of art (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/graphene-veils-may-hold-the-secret-to-conserving-priceless-works-of-art/)

All art establishments are concerned with the degradation of paintings. Harmful factors such as sunlight, moisture, and certain volatile organic compounds can accelerate degradation. Graphene may be the solution to protecting art from exposure to harmful agents. A one-atom-thick sheet of graphene can adhere easily to various substrates and serve as an excellent barrier against oxygen, gases, moisture, and UV light. The graphene sheets can be added to framing glass for artworks with extremely rough surfaces or embossed patterns. The sheets can be removed using a soft rubber eraser.

## [Scientists Splice Human Gene Into Potatoes to Make Them Grow Huge (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/splice-human-gene-potatoes)

A team of scientists has increased the size of their potato crops by splicing a human gene that encodes a fat-regulating protein into them. The potatoes grew 50 percent larger than usual, opening up the possibility of growing more food without taking up more space for agriculture. Plants don't have a protein comparable to the one the scientists spliced in, so the scientists had no idea what the outcome of the experiment would be. The scientists plan to conduct various safety and replication studies to confirm their results.

## [With Seven Floors in 12 Days, China Builds Hotel in Record Time (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/with-seven-floors-in-12-days-china-builds-hotel-in-record-time)

The China State Construction company recently put together a seven-story hotel in just 12 days. Most of the hotel was built in an automated factory. Once the parts and components of the building were ready, the workers simply had to piece them together on-site. Each component was digitally monitored to quickly identify faults and fix them. The process reduces material waste, construction waste, and energy consumption, as well as noise pollution on-site. A 30-second video showing the construction process is available in the article.
