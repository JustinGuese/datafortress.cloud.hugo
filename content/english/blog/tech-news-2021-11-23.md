## [Rolls-Royce's all-electric airplane smashes record with 387.4 MPH top speed (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/rolls-royces-all-electric-airplane-hits-a-record-3874-mph-top-speed-082803118.html)

Rolls-Royce's 'Spirit of Innovation', an old-school tail-dragger airplane powered by an electric motor, has hit a top speed of 387.4 mph, smashing the speed record for electric airplanes. Electric airplanes aren't practical yet as batteries are 50 times less energy-dense than jet fuel, but they could be potentially used for short trips. The battery pack used in Rolls-Royce's plane is the most power-dense propulsion battery pack ever assembled. A picture of the plane is available in the article.
