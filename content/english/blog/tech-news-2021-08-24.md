## [Google Pay team reportedly in major upheaval after botched app revamp (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/google-pay-team-reportedly-in-major-upheaval-after-botched-app-revamp/)

Google Pay's recent revamp was a disaster, with a difficult transition period for customers to a service with less features. The app transition was also frustrating for employees, with dozens of employees and executives leaving the Google Payments team in recent months. Google had wanted to update Google Pay to be more in line with the version the company had built for India. The service only had a 3 percent market share for NFC mobile payments. Google plans to open a full banking service in partnership with Citibank.

## [Farmers Are Creating Circular Gardens in the Sahara Desert. Hereâ€™s Why (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/farmers-are-creating-circular-gardens-in-the-sahara-desert-heres-why)

The Great Green Wall project was launched in 2007 to help prevent desertification in Africa. Overall, the program has only managed to plant four percent of the pledged 100 million hectares due to issues with planting trees in the desert and a lack of funding. Senegalese farmers have started to build circular gardens with plants and trees that produce fruits and medicines as part of the project. The circular pattern allows roots to grow inwards, trapping liquids and bacteria and enhancing water retention and composting. The gardens were a response to the pandemic, as Senegal had to close its borders and many villages were dependent on foreign food and medicines.

## [Scientist Captures First-Ever Footage of a Tortoise Committing Grisly Murder (3 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3d485/scientist-captures-first-ever-footage-of-a-tortoise-committing-grisly-murder)

Scientists have captured footage of a giant tortoise killing and eating a baby bird. It is the first documented observation of a tortoise deliberately attacking and consuming another animal. There are reports of giant tortoises killing other animals, but none have been deliberate acts of hunting. Giant tortoises are almost entirely herbivorous, but a boom in bird populations in the area may have resulted in tortoises adopting bird chicks into their diets. The video is available in the article.

## [Old iPhones become faster if you change the region to France (2 minute read)](https://www.gizchina.com/2021/08/23/old-iphones-become-faster-if-you-change-the-region-to-france/)

Recent benchmark tests found that old iPhones, for example, the iPhone 7, run slightly faster after switching regions to France. A few years ago, Apple was found to intentionally reduce the performance output of old iPhones. Apple had to pay a fine in France, but it avoided paying fines in most other regions by adding battery health options in iOS and introducing a policy to reduce the price of replacement batteries. The reduction of iPhone performance doesn't affect new iPhones. Performance test results are available in the article.
