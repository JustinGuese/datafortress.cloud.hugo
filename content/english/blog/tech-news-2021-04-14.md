## [Facebook is testing a video speed-dating app called Sparked (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature)

Sparked is a new video speed dating app from Facebook's New Product Experimentation (NPE) Team. During events, the app cycles people through speed video dates that last four minutes. If the date goes well, the pair can schedule a longer meeting. Users have to fill in questions when signing up that indicate that kindness is a major factor when qualifying for the app. The NPE Team has launched many apps with little success, so it is unclear how committed Facebook will be to this project.

## [A Massive New Gene Editing Project Is Out to Crush Alzheimer’s (6 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2021/04/13/a-massive-new-gene-editing-project-is-out-to-crush-alzheimers/)

The iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) is a project that aims to stimulate, accelerate, and support research that will lead to the development of improved treatments and preventions for Alzheimer's and other dementias. The plan involves adding more than 100 genes linked to Alzheimer’s and other dementias into stem cells from a wide variety of donors to see which genes contribute to the disorder. It will investigate how the genes activate, what proteins they code for, how those proteins interact, and more. All of the data from the project will be openly shared online for anyone to mine and interpret.
