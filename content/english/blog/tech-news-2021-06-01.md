## [Talking to Animals: Using AI to Decode the Language of Whales (8 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/talking-to-animals-with-ai-decoding-whale-language)

Project CETI (Cetacean Translation Initiative) is a scientific endeavor with the goal of using machine learning to better understand sperm whale language. Sperm whales communicate through a series of intensely loud clicks called codas. The clicks can reach up to 230 decibels, allowing them to communicate with each other over hundreds of miles. Sperm whales have brains six times the size of human brains and they contain cells responsible for empathy, social organization, and speech. CETI plans to collect as much data as possible to see if AI can process the codas into something we can understand.
