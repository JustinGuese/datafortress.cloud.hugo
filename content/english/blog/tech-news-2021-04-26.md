The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) is a machine that can extract breathable oxygen from carbon dioxide on Mars. It heats Martian air to about 1,470 degrees Fahrenheit and then extracts oxygen from it using a process called solid oxide electrolysis.

Oxygen will be needed to fuel a return trip to Mars.
