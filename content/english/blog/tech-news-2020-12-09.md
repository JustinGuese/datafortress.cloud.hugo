The drones are designed to drop tree seeds in places where they have a decent chance of survival.

## [France to build new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (2 minute read)](https://apnews.com/article/energy-industry-paris-emmanuel-macron-france-35a0b0a597db97b899108ec8a8c94856/1/01000176472f7851-23e8bf2d-e573-42ca-8334-aee797a664ff-000000/9jUBRV3yir0Hul998Pt09vnnXg7Fs2MEXGniFqp_FzY=170)

France is building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to replace its Charles de Gaulle carrier by 2038. According to French President Emmanuel Macron, the decision is part of France's climate strategy, and a nuclear-powered warship would output lower emissions compared to one powered by diesel fuel. An aircraft carrier would also help France project its global influence, as only a few countries in the world maintain the huge, costly vessels. The new aircraft carrier will weigh around 70,000 tons and measure 300 meters long. It will be designed to accommodate next-generation warplanes and serve until 2080. The estimated cost of the warship will be 7 billion euros.

## [US cybersecurity firm FireEye says it was hacked, probably by 'nation-state' (3 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/08/fireeye-hack-cybersecurity-theft/1/01000176472f7851-23e8bf2d-e573-42ca-8334-aee797a664ff-000000/Bd0_LduKwflYDNUxpKaPJj4mLn6IX74zSagtEt16uLY=170)

One of the largest cybersecurity companies in the US, FireEye, claims it was hacked by a foreign government. Internal tools used for testing clients' defenses were stolen in the attack. FireEye has an array of business contracts across the national security space in the US and around the world. The stolen kit targets a myriad of different vulnerabilities in popular software products. All of these vulnerabilities should already be public, but FireEye has not disclosed what systems may be affected. Typically, companies will release patches for known vulnerabilities, but users do not always download these patches.

## [Cloudflare, Apple, and others back a new way to make the Internet more private (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/12/cloudflare-apple-and-others-back-a-new-way-to-make-the-internet-more-private//1/01000176472f7851-23e8bf2d-e573-42ca-8334-aee797a664ff-000000/Kik72dGngiMuJ9xh9RE3wjoe1KgRgbWjabYwurZKQc0=170)

Whenever you access a website, your browser gets the website's IP from a DNS resolver which is typically operated by either your ISP or a service such as Google's 8.8.8.8. These queries are unencrypted, so it is possible for someone to monitor which sites are being visited or even redirect the request to a fake website. A new technique developed by Cloudflare, Apple, and Fastly, called Oblivious DNS, can prevent this snooping and make the Internet more private. Engineers are still measuring the performance cost of implementing the protocol, but early results appear promising.
