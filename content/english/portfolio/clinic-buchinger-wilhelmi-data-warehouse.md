## Case Study: Modernizing Data Infrastructure for Buchinger Wilhelmi Fasting Clinic

**Client**: Buchinger Wilhelmi

### Project Overview:

Buchinger Wilhelmi, the world’s leading fasting clinic, sought to enhance their treatment personalization and research capabilities through advanced data management. The goal was to establish a robust data warehouse that complies with stringent German healthcare regulations, specifically the Kliniklandeskrankenhausgesetz, while enabling efficient data processing and personalized app-based suggestions for patients.

### Objective:

To architect and implement a secure, scalable data warehouse solution with an efficient ETL pipeline, ensuring compliance with German privacy laws and enabling the clinic to deliver personalized treatment advice and facilitate comprehensive research analytics.

### Solution Design Process:

#### Requirement Analysis:

- Engaged with Buchinger Wilhelmi’s medical and IT teams to understand their specific needs, regulatory constraints, and data processing requirements.
- Identified the necessity for a secure, on-premises solution due to the restrictions on using public cloud providers.

#### Technology Selection:

- Chose Kubernetes for its robust container orchestration capabilities, enabling autoscaling, load balancing, and efficient resource management on bare-metal servers.
- Selected Prefect as the ETL scheduler for its efficiency and flexibility over traditional tools like Airflow.
- Decided on Minio for S3-compatible object storage, facilitating seamless data staging between ETL steps.
- Opted for PostgreSQL as the final data repository for its reliability and compatibility with analytical tools.

#### Architecture Design:

- Designed a Kubernetes cluster on bare-metal servers to ensure compliance with German healthcare regulations and provide scalability.
- Implemented a comprehensive ETL pipeline managed by Prefect, orchestrating the ingestion, processing, and transformation of medical data.
- Configured Minio S3 buckets for intermediate data storage, ensuring smooth data flow between ETL stages.
- Established PostgreSQL databases to store the final processed data, enabling easy access for app-based personalized recommendations and research analytics.

### Implementation:

#### Infrastructure Setup:

- Deployed a Kubernetes cluster on bare-metal servers, ensuring high availability, autoscaling, and load balancing to handle varying workloads.
- Configured Prefect as the ETL scheduler, defining and orchestrating the necessary data processing workflows.

#### ETL Pipeline Development:

- Developed ETL processes to extract medical data, transform it into useful formats, and load it into the data warehouse.
- Utilized Minio S3 buckets for staging data at different ETL steps, ensuring seamless transitions and data integrity.
- Finalized the processed data in PostgreSQL databases, making it available for further analysis and application use.

#### Data Utilization:

- Integrated the processed data with a personalized app, providing users with tailored fasting recommendations based on their medical data.
- Developed analytical dashboards for the research department and doctors, enabling data-driven improvements in treatment protocols.

### Results:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Successfully implemented a secure, on-premises data warehouse solution that complies with the Kliniklandeskrankenhausgesetz.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Enabled personalized fasting recommendations through a user-friendly app, enhancing patient treatment experiences.
- **Improved Research Capabilities**: Provided the research department and medical professionals with comprehensive analytical dashboards, facilitating data-driven insights and treatment improvements.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Achieved efficient data processing and transformation through the use of Prefect and Minio, ensuring timely and accurate data availability.

### Conclusion:

The project resulted in a state-of-the-art data warehouse solution for Buchinger Wilhelmi, leveraging advanced technologies to comply with German healthcare regulations and significantly enhance patient treatment personalization and research capabilities. By implementing a secure, on-premises infrastructure with efficient ETL processes, the clinic can now offer personalized recommendations and drive continuous improvements in fasting treatments.
