## Case Study: Designing a Global Backup Solution for BMW’s Virtual Machines and File Sharing Tools

**Client**: BMW / HPE

{{< youtube OEPQSiFrDR8 >}}

### Project Overview:

BMW required a robust and scalable backup solution for their extensive and globally distributed virtual machine (VM) systems and file sharing tools. The primary challenge was to identify a backup solution capable of handling the massive data volume, amounting to hundreds of petabytes, while ensuring data reliability, efficient deduplication, and overcoming bandwidth limitations.

### Objective:

To research, compare, and implement a comprehensive backup strategy that leverages both cloud storage providers and on-premises HPE deduplication servers, ensuring cost-efficiency and high reliability.

### Solution Design Process:

#### Requirement Gathering:

- Conducted detailed discussions with BMW’s IT team to understand the specific needs and constraints regarding data backup.
- Identified critical parameters like data volume, bandwidth limitations, disk write speeds, and the importance of data deduplication.

#### Research and Analysis:

- Performed extensive research on various cloud storage providers, evaluating their bandwidth limits, disk write speeds, and scalability.
- Analyzed the cost implications of using different cloud providers for such massive data volumes.
- Investigated HPE’s deduplication technology and its potential to integrate with both cloud and on-premises storage solutions.

#### Comparison of Cloud Providers:

Compared leading cloud storage providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) focusing on:
- Bandwidth limits
- Disk write speeds
- Cost per petabyte of storage
- Data redundancy and reliability features  
Assessed the feasibility of these providers to handle BMW’s backup needs effectively.

#### Hybrid Backup Solution Development:

- Designed a hybrid backup strategy combining multiple cloud providers to ensure multi-reliability and avoid single points of failure.
- Incorporated HPE deduplication servers to significantly reduce the data volume needing backup, addressing the bandwidth limitations.
- Ensured that the most critical data was backed up in a deduplicated manner to further enhance cost-efficiency and data protection.

### Implementation:

#### Integration:

- Implemented the hybrid backup solution with seamless integration between on-premises HPE deduplication servers and selected cloud storage providers.
- Developed a systematic backup schedule to optimize bandwidth usage and prevent any potential bottlenecks.

#### Testing and Validation:

- Conducted rigorous testing to ensure data integrity, backup speeds, and the efficiency of deduplication processes.
- Validated the reliability of the solution through multiple failover tests and data recovery drills.

#### Optimization:

- Continuously monitored the backup processes to identify and rectify any inefficiencies.
- Fine-tuned the balance between on-premises and cloud storage to maximize cost savings without compromising on data security and accessibility.

### Results:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Demonstrated that a self-hosted, deduplicated backup setup can be significantly more cost-effective than relying solely on cloud storage providers, especially for large-scale data volumes.
- **Data Reliability**: Achieved high data reliability through a combination of multi-cloud redundancy and HPE’s robust deduplication technology.
- **Bandwidth Management**: Successfully mitigated bandwidth limitations by utilizing HPE servers to reduce the data volume needing transfer to cloud storage.
- **Scalability**: Ensured the solution could scale with BMW’s growing data needs, providing a sustainable long-term backup strategy.

### Conclusion:

The project culminated in a highly efficient, scalable, and cost-effective backup solution for BMW’s worldwide VM systems and file sharing tools. By leveraging a hybrid approach with both cloud storage and on-premises HPE deduplication servers, we not only met but exceeded the client’s expectations, ensuring data reliability and significant cost savings.
