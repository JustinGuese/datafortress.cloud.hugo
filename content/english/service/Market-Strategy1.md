## Why is Cloud Computing so important?

> **$330 billion USD** is the market prediction for the global public [cloud computing](https://www.datafortress.cloud/cloud-services/cloud-computing/) market in 2020

>  **94% of workloads** will be processed by Cloud data centers in 2021

**These are huge numbers – but you might wonder if your company should either enter or extend its cloud presence or if it is safe to ignore this huge movement, but do not worry – we are here to clear up any misunderstandings.**

<br>

## What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the transition of traditional on-premise infrastructure to a service provider that includes either a 1:1 replica of the on-premise environment or even more likely an upgrade of existing processes using services or “tools” that the cloud offers.

<br>

## What are the benefits of Cloud Computing

<br>

### **1. Maintenance Reduction**

<br>

<br>

We are a technology leader, meaning we constantly research and implement state-of-the-art tools. Avoid making the wrong choice and learn how to engage customers in turbulent new times.  
Old business models are changing and need to be transferred to the digital world. Save yourself the trouble and connect with an expert.

<br>

### **2. Cost Savings**

<br>

<br>

Together with the aforementioned point, reducing downtimes of your services includes more revenue and less lost sales, therefore counting into the cost-saving factor as well. Additionally, the great cloud companies can offer to host at much lower prices compared to on-premise environments, because they manage huge data centers at once, therefore being able to reduce their costs according to the mass of goods they buy. Oftentimes it might sound cheaper to buy for example a server (\~1,200$) instead of renting one (e.g. 1,200$ = 2$/h rental price * 24 h = 25 days ROI), but one has to keep in mind that components will break, causing downtime, adding replacement and personal costs, power usage and so on. All these factors together oftentimes make it cheaper to rent infrastructure instead of maintaining it, let alone the savings that are possible utilizing new technologies like serverless.

<br>

### **3. A new architecture / Serverless**

<br>

<br>

Of course, the most simple step would be to transition the on-premise system as a replica into the cloud, but the huge benefit of the cloud is its services like for example serverless. There has been a shift in Infrastructure management, from being forced to manage everything, including hardware repairs and so on, to rather abstract management of just the programs a business needs. Let us take a data science team as an example. In the traditional environment, they need to set up the hardware of a computer, need to install an operating system and maintain it, install the newest version of their programming language and maintain it, and finally do it all again if something breaks in their system. And that didn’t even touch their code that is essential for your business! What if they would just need to worry about their code and turn their tools “on” and “off” as they wish? That is essentially what the goal of serverless is. Your team is just worried about their code, and everything else is done in the background by a cloud provider.

### 4. Scaling

<br>

<br>

Another huge benefit weighing in is scaling. Let us take Black Friday as an example. Let us say an online retailer is dealing with \~100 orders a day. Therefore he buys a server architecture that can handle \~200 orders a day. But once a year, on Black Friday, there are 2000 orders a day, causing his system to crash, and therefore missing many orders. Now he could buy a bigger system to handle 3000 orders a day, but that would mean on 364 days a year he is overpaying a lot for his architecture. Now using new technologies, he could rent a bigger machine for some hours off a cloud provider, or even better use automatic scaling. Because in some cases demand can be unpredictable, like a viral post leading to many visitors or something similar. Therefore new cloud technologies offer a way of automatic scaling, meaning that the resources can scale according to the computational demand in an instant.

### 5. Security

<br>

<br>

Even though many people hear a lot of potential cloud leaks, all in all, the cloud is almost every time more secure than an on-premise environment. Many on-premise systems get set up once but are never updated or reviewed again, leaving room for many potential security threats. Many cloud services, on the other hand, are constantly updated in the background, especially if you are using a serverless architecture. Of course, the cloud offers new potential security leaks, like leaving access open to an IP range outside of your business, but once you know what you are doing and what you should keep in mind, the cloud is all in all more secure.

**Now, this has only been a brief peek into this huge topic of the cloud, and of course, the situation is different for every company. Therefore it is even more important to engage with a team that already fought through a lot of potential stepping stones to save yourself trouble and money on your journey towards the cloud.
