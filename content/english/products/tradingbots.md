# Tradingbots

I have been developing trading bots for some time, and have written backtest software on a private Kubernetes cluster that simulates a real market environment. As soon as I have developed a new "bot theory", it will be tested. The current test has been running for 13 months, and initial candidates are promising.
Some bot ideas can be seen at https://aistockpriceprediction.com/, as well as in some posts I have published:
