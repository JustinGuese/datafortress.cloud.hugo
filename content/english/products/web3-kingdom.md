# DeFi/Web3: Kingdom Game

https://github.com/JustinGuese/solidity-kingdom-game 

I wrote a Web3 game that simulates a kingdom and acts as a pool at the same time. Users can buy "seedcoin" and "plant" them, after which they can "harvest" the seeds after a locking period to buy new combat or defense units. Should you successfully fight their "boss", they will move up in the rankings. The ranking is realized by NFTs, and the "higher" a NFT is in the ranking, the more profit from the pooling reward is distributed to the NFTs. The software is written in solidity (ETH chain) and React (JS).
