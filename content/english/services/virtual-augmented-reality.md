## EXPERTISE IN VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY

So what is causing this huge prediction of AR and VR?  
Currently, we are used to two-dimensional screens to gather information, but with augmented or virtual reality we are adding a new dimension which allows for way more input to be received. Furthermore, we are living in a three-dimensional world, so naturally, we are way more used to interact in a virtual three-dimensional world and even people that are not used to interact with computers can usually easily handle these environments.

But what makes Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality so interesting?

### Virtual Reality

<br>

![](/images/vr.webp)  
Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality can include entertainment (i.e. video games) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality?oldformat=true))

<br>

### Augmented Reality

<br>

![](/images/augmented-reality.webp)  
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality?oldformat=true))

<br><br>

## Mixed Reality Services

<br>

### 1. Everyone can use it

Especially with Augmented Reality, almost all current smartphones support it. This means, that users do not need anything more than a phone (which everyone has) and an internet connection to view content. Virtual reality glasses are currently still only affordable for dedicated users, but with the time prices will go down and these glasses might be at home like current televisions.

<br>

### 2. Endless possibilities

The nice thing about virtual and augmented reality is, that we are not bound to constraints of reality. Take a movie for example: For once, it is hard to cram all the content into a specified time, the screen size itself, and film stunts requiring really dangerous settings. With a virtual environment, everything is possible. Do you want to make users fly with their own arms? Possible. Bend the laws of physics and let users levitate? All is possible with these exciting possibilities.

<br>

### 3. Enormous interactivity

Several studies show, that both technologies are way more “immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence” (Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/ "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/")), and therefore engaging than traditional learning and advertisement methods. As anyone can relate, this is true, because if you are doing things instead of just watching how to do it, it becomes way easier to understand.

<br>

### 4. A new start for advertisements

>  “65 percent of users find ads annoying”

According to a recent study (Source [https://bit.ly/2Ogj4KM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/ "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389766/")), 65 percent of users find advertisements annoying, mainly because they are interrupting what users are doing. Now with AR and VR, users can choose when to play the content and are way more likely to start an interaction with the content – and therefore offer ads a new start and possibly a change from a necessity, to something users may enjoy.

## Applications of AR and VR

No matter if you are planning a specific project or you are just trying to inform yourself – we are the right partner to either consult, analyze or execute your ideas. Let us have a look at the applications or “the new realities” below.

<br>

### 1. Virtual Reality Experiences

<br>

![](/images/vr-1.webp)

In the past, we produced several virtual reality applications, like a virtual reality racing simulator or a used car experience (see portfolio for further information).

Virtual reality offers a vast amount of experiences, which are basically unlimited due to the fact that you are able to create everything with a computer – no matter if that is a racing simulator, a shooter game or a product demo – the possibilities are endless.

Our VR projects include:

* Virtual showroom, product experiences
* Virtual Reality Multiplayer Games and Experiences
* Motion Simulators utilizing VR
* Virtual Reality Meetings (Homeoffice)
* Virtual Reality Presentations
* Virtual Reality concerts, operas, theaters
* Virtual Reality real estate experiences
* Virtual Tours for bars, retail, real estate
* “Funrides” in theme parks and water slides
* Data Augmentation
* Virtual Reality in a real environment

<br>

### 2. Augmented Reality

<br>

![](/images/arr.webp)

Augmented Reality offers a new way to bring virtual experiences to the broad mass. Of course, current VR headsets offer a higher quality experience, but only a few handfuls of people own a VR-headset, therefore limiting the expose to VR content. Depending on the use-case it might make more sense to prefer Augmented Reality because almost everyone owns a smartphone that can display AR experiences. Furthermore, some users experience a feeling of discomfort when wearing virtual reality glasses, therefore making the AR experience more comfortable for that group of users, because an environment that they know is getting augmented instead of them being transferred into a completely new world.

**Our AR services include:**

* Augmented Reality advertisements
* Content enrichments using AR
* AR content in print media
* AR product presentations
* AR using Microsoft Hololense
* AR car sales
* AR training
* AR meetings, online meetings, and home office applications
* AR theme parks
* AR fun rides
* AR presentations
* AR web advertisements
* AR retail presentations
* AR car configurators

  
<br>

### 3. Data Augmentation

<br>  
![](/images/aug.webp)

Data is becoming more and more important. Therefore it is becoming increasingly relevant to improve data presentation. Numbers alone are not sufficient enough, the audience needs to understand them as well. This is where data augmentation comes into play, describing a way to utilize virtual and augmented reality to enrich data and present it in a completely new way, setting it apart from PowerPoint presentations.

**Our data augmentation services include:**

* Interactive data experiences in Virtual Reality
* Augmented Reality projections on real-life products
* Data Interaction with virtual reality
* 2D to 3D enrichments of Excel, PowerPoint & similar
* Interactive spreadsheets, data presentations
* Data narrations using virtual and augmented reality

<br>

### 4. Virtual/Augmented Reality Simulators

<br>

![](/images/vrsim.webp)  
Virtual/Augmented Reality simulators offer a great way to train processes that are expensive or dangerous in the real world in a safe environment. Depending on the use case these experiences can be focused on being educative or entertaining, both making traditional training methods more memorable and effective. Save yourself expensive equipment and train your staff with hands-on experience that will remain way more memorable than traditional presentations.

**Our simulator services include:**

* driver license simulator
* electric car battery installation training
* training for dangerous environments (radioactive, firefighting, poisonous, toxic spills, …)
* healthcare simulations (surgery, emergency response, …)
* airplane simulations
* medical education (anatomy, …)
* training for handling expensive parts (electric car battery installation, airplane repairs, …)
* survival simulators
* fun simulators like skiing-, crane-, hobby pilot-, theme park-, driving-simulators
